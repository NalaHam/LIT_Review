"1",74,"Sex-linked genetic mechanisms and atrial fibrillation risk",2022,"Eur J Med Genet","Wren, G. and Davies, W.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac condition characterised by an irregular heartbeat, atrial pathology and an elevated downstream risk of thrombosis and heart failure, as well as neurological sequelae including stroke and dementia. The prevalence and presentation of, risk factors for, and therapeutic responses to, AF differ by sex, and this sex bias may be partially explained in terms of genetics. Here, we consider four sex-linked genetic mechanisms that may influence sex-biased phenotypes related to AF and provide examples of each: X-linked gene dosage, X-linked genomic imprinting, sex-biased autosomal gene expression, and male-limited Y-linked gene expression. We highlight novel candidate risk genes and pathways that warrant further investigation in clinical and preclinical studies. Understanding the biological basis of sex differences in AF should allow better prediction of disease risk, identification of novel risk/protective factors, and the development of more effective sex-tailored interventions.","","x","x","","x","imprinting, male-limited Y-linked gene expression","atrial fibrillation, cardiac, stroke, dementia","imprinting","","","","","might give example mechanisms that we can use "
