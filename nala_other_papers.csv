R. and L√ºbbert, M.","Alpha thalassaemia myelodysplastic syndrome (ATMDS) is an unusual complication of chronic myeloid malignancy that is associated with a striking red cell phenotype. It represents an acquired form of alpha-thalassaemia that most commonly arises in the context of myelodysplasia. It has recently been shown that this condition occurs in association with somatic mutations of a known X-encoded trans-acting regulator of alpha globin gene (HBA) expression, ATRX. There is an unexplained, strong male preponderance of individuals with the ATMDS phenotype with a >5:1 male-female ratio and furthermore, all the somatic ATRX mutations described to date have been in males. Here we report the identification, in a single centre, of two females with ATMDS and mutations in the ATRX gene, proving that ATMDS associated with such mutations may occur, albeit rarely, in females. It seemed possible that females might be less likely to develop ATMDS if the inactivated copy of the ATRX gene (ATRX) became progressively re-activated throughout life. This study ruled out this hypothesis by investigating the pattern of ATRX inactivation in a cross-sectional analysis of normal females at ages ranging from newborn to 90 years.","experiment","ATRX","x","","","EXCI","alpha thalassaemia myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloid malignancy, ","case study","","","","","very relevant"

Gender difference regarding prevalence and incidence of the most important age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, Type 2 diabetes, disability, autoimmunity and infections, are reviewed and updated with particular attention to the role of the immune system and immunosenescence. On the whole, gender differences appear to be pervasive and still poorly considered and investigated despite their biomedical relevance. The basic biological mechanisms responsible for gender differences in aging and longevity are quite complex and still poorly understood. The present review focuses on centenarians and their offspring as a model of healthy aging and summarizes available knowledge on three basic biological phenomena, i.e. age-related X chromosome inactivation skewing, gut microbiome changes and maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA genetic variants. In conclusion, an appropriate gender-specific medicine approach is urgently needed and should be systematically pursued in studies on healthy aging, longevity and age-related diseases, in a globalized world characterized by great gender differences which have a high impact on health and diseases.","review","","","","","XCI","cardiovascular, neurological, cancer, type 2 diabetes, disability, autoimmune, infection","","","","","","relevant"
"3",71,"Sex Differences in Immunity: Implications for the Development of Novel Vaccines Against Emerging Pathogens",2020,"Front Immunol","Fathi, A. and Addo, M. M. and Dahlke, C.","Vaccines are one of the greatest public health achievements and have saved millions of lives. They represent a key countermeasure to limit epidemics caused by emerging infectious diseases. The Ebola virus disease crisis in West Africa dramatically revealed the need for a rapid and strategic development of vaccines to effectively control outbreaks. Seven years later, in light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this need has never been as urgent as it is today. Vaccine development and implementation of clinical trials have been greatly accelerated, but still lack strategic design and evaluation. Responses to vaccination can vary widely across individuals based on factors like age, microbiome, co-morbidities and sex. The latter aspect has received more and more attention in recent years and a growing body of data provide evidence that sex-specific effects may lead to different outcomes of vaccine safety and efficacy. As these differences might have a significant impact on the resulting optimal vaccine regimen, sex-based differences should already be considered and investigated in pre-clinical and clinical trials. In this Review, we will highlight the clinical observations of sex-specific differences in response to vaccination, delineate sex differences in immune mechanisms, and will discuss the possible resulting implications for development of vaccine candidates against emerging infections. As multiple vaccine candidates against COVID-19 that target the same antigen are tested, vaccine development may undergo a decisive change, since we now have the opportunity to better understand mechanisms that influence vaccine-induced reactogenicity and effectiveness of different vaccines.","review","","","","","immune system","vaccines","","","","","","Sex differences in vaccines"
"4",302,"XWAS: A Software Toolset for Genetic Data Analysis and Association Studies of the X Chromosome",2015,"Journal of Heredity","Gao, F. and Chang, D. and Biddanda, A. and Ma, L. and Guo, Y. and Zhou, Z. and Keinan, A.","XWAS is a new software suite for the analysis of the X chromosome in association studies and similar genetic studies. The X chromosome plays an important role in human disease and traits of many species, especially those with sexually dimorphic characteristics. Special attention needs to be given to its analysis due to the unique inheritance pattern, which leads to analytical complications that have resulted in the majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) either not considering X or mishandling it with toolsets that had been designed for non-sex chromosomes. We hence developed XWAS to fill the need for tools that are specially designed for analysis of X. Following extensive, stringent, and X-specific quality control, XWAS offers an array of statistical tests of association, including: 1) the standard test between a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and disease risk, including after first stratifying individuals by sex, 2) a test for a differential effect of a SNP on disease between males and females, 3) motivated by X-inactivation, a test for higher variance of a trait in heterozygous females as compared with homozygous females, and 4) for all tests, a version that allows for combining evidence from all SNPs across a gene. We applied the toolset analysis pipeline to 16 GWAS datasets of immune-related disorders and 7 risk factors of coronary artery disease, and discovered several new X-linked genetic associations. XWAS will provide the tools and incentive for others to incorporate the X chromosome into GWAS and similar studies in any species with an XX/XY system, hence enabling discoveries of novel loci implicated in many diseases and in their sexual dimorphism.","tool","x","x","","","XCI","x","","GWAS, XWAS","","","",""

G. and Bras, M. and Van Montfoort, A. P. A. and Kester, A. D. M. and Evers, J. L. H. and Geraedts, J. P. M. and Coonen, E.","Background: There is concern that IVF and/or ICSI might have an adverse effect on embryonic development via epigenetic alterations. Such alterations might also be involved in the sex-related growth differences in preimplantation embryos found in some animal species. In the present study we analysed cell numbers of human male and female surplus embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage after either IVF or ICSI in order to investigate possible sex-dependent differential growth rates. Methods: Blastocysts resulting from surplus embryos obtained after either IVF or ICSI during a 5 year study period were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: The number of cells and sex could be determined in 330 blastocysts collected from 92 IVF cycles and in 322 blastocysts collected from 121 ICSI cycles. Whereas female and male embryos originating from IVF showed comparable mean log cell numbers per embryo ¬± SEM (3.76 ¬± 0.05 in 147 female and 3.72 ¬± 0.04 in 183 male embryos), significant differences were observed in embryos originating from ICSI (3.57 ¬± 0.05 in 162 female and 3.90 ¬± 0.03 in 160 male embryos). The sex-related growth difference was significantly greater in ICSI than in IVF embryos. In a subset of 84 embryos, inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) were analysed separately. A significantly higher mean log cell number of TE cells in ICSI male embryos was found as compared to their female counterparts (3.44 ¬± 0.12 in 16 female and 3.90 ¬± 0.11 in 29 male embryos), whereas this difference was not found in IVF embryos. Conclusion: A clear sex-related growth difference was found in human blastocysts originating from ICSI, but not in blastocysts originating from IVF. It is as yet unknown which mechanism is responsible for our findings. We hypothesize that the ICSI procedure might interfere with the process of imprinted X-inactivation. ¬© European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.","experiment","","","","","XCI","ivf, icsi","","","","x","",""
