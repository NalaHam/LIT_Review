"1",64,"X Chromosome Inactivation Timing is Not eXACT: Implications for Autism Spectrum Disorders",2022,"Front Genet","LaSalle, J. M.","The etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is complex, involving different combinations of genetic and environmental factors. My lab's approach has been to investigate DNA methylation as a tractable genome-wide modification at the interface of these complex interactions, reflecting past and future events in the molecular pathogenesis of ASD. Since X-linked genes were enriched in DNA methylation differences discovered from cord blood from newborns later diagnosed with ASD, this has prompted me to review and revisit the recent advancements in the field of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), particularly in humans and other primates. In this Perspective, I compare XCI mechanisms in different mammalian species, including the finding of the noncoding transcript XACT associated with X chromosome erosion in human pluripotent stem cells and recent findings from non-human primate post-implantation embryos. I focus on the experimentally challenging peri- and post-implantation stages of human development when the timing of XCI is prolonged and imprecise in humans. Collectively, this research has raised some important unanswered questions involving biased sex ratios in human births and the male bias in the incidence of ASD.","experimental","XACT","x","x","","XCI","autism","DNA methylation","human, animal, primate","","","",""
"2",321,"The influence of sex on brain development genetics and the possible relationship with sex-dependent differences in psychiatric disorders",2021,"Gazi Medical Journal","Baƒücaz, A. and Terzi, Y. K. and ≈ûahin, F. ƒ∞","There are sex-dependent differences in the prevalence, age of onset, and course of psychiatric disorders and cognitive abilities. Although it has been assumed that the direct effect of gonadal hormones in sensitive periods leads to sexually dimorphic brain development, current evidence suggests that another possible factor may be sex-specific regulations at the gene level. Understanding the sex differences at the gene level can be promising to identify the mechanisms that predispose or trigger psychiatric disorders, and may provide new prevention or treatment strategies. This paper aims to review the findings on the mechanisms that affect the sex-specific differences in brain development at the gene level and to discuss the relationship of these findings with different cognitive characteristics of the sexes and psychiatric disorders.","review","","","","","","psychiatric disorders, neurological","","","","","",""
"3",322,"Sex differences in child-onset, life-course-persistent conduct disorder. A review of biological influences",2007,"Clinical Psychology Review","Eme, R. F.","Sex is widely acknowledged to be an important factor in understanding many aspects of behavior, not the least of which is antisocial behavior. When antisocial behavior manifests itself in the domain of juvenile psychopathology, it often takes the form of a type of conduct disorder (CD) that begins in childhood and is life-course-persistent. There is an overwhelming consensus that there is a massive male preponderance in this type of CD and that biological variables are major influences on this difference. This review built on this consensual scaffolding in an attempt to provide some useful leads for identifying the biological contributions to the predominantly male complexion of life-course-persistent CD by linking it to three different levels of biological mechanisms.

J. and Bertsch, N. L. and Klee, E. W. and Hasadsri, L. and Pichurin, P. N. and Rankin, J. and Raymond, F. L. and Clayton-Smith, J.","DDX3X (Xp11.4) encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase that escapes X chromosome inactivation. Pathogenic variants in DDX3X have been shown to cause X-linked intellectual disability (ID) (MRX102, MIM: 300958). The phenotypes associated with DDX3X variants are heterogeneous and include brain and behavioral abnormalities, microcephaly, hypotonia, and movement disorders and/or spasticity. The majority of DDX3X variants described are de novo mutations in females with ID. In contrast, most male DDX3X variants are inherited from an unaffected mother, with one documented exception being a recently identified de novo splice site variant. It has been suggested, therefore, that DDX3X exerts its effects through haploinsufficiency in females, and that affected males carry hypomorphic alleles that retain partial function. Given the lack of male de novo DDX3X variants, loss-of-function variants in this gene are suspected to be male lethal. Through whole-exome sequencing, we identified three unrelated males with hemizygous missense DDX3X variants and ID. All three variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, with two established as de novo. In silico analyses were supportive of pathogenicity. We report the male phenotypes and compare them to phenotypes observed in previously reported male and female patients. In conclusion, we propose that de novo DDX3X variants are not necessarily male lethal and should be considered as a cause of syndromic ID in both males and females.","experiment","DDX3X","","","","","intellectual disability, behavioral, neurological, microcephaly, hypotonia","","Sanger sequencing","","x","",""
"5",340,"Sex chromosome complement affects social interactions in mice",2008,"Hormones and Behavior","McPhie-Lalmansingh, A. A. and Tejada, L. D. and Weaver, J. L. and Rissman, E. F.","Sex differences in behavior can be attributed to differences in steroid hormones. Sex chromosome complement can also influence behavior, independent of gonadal differentiation. The mice used for this work combined a spontaneous mutation of the Sty gene with a transgene for Sty that is incorporated into an autosome thus disassociating gonad differentiation from sex chromosome complement. The resulting genotypes are XX and XY- females (ovary-bearing) along with XXSry and XY(-)Sry males (testes-bearing). Here we report results of basic behavioral phenotyping conducted with these mice. Motor coordination, use of olfactory cues to find a food item, general activity, foot shock threshold, and behavior in an elevated plus maze were not affected by gonadal sex or sex chromosome complement. In a one-way active avoidance learning task females were faster to escape an electric shock than males. In addition, sex chromosome complement differences were noted during social interactions with submissive intruders. Female XY- mice were faster to follow an intruder than XX female mice. All XY- mice spent more time sniffing and grooming the intruder than the XX mice, with XY- females spending the most amount of time in this activity. Finally, XX females were faster to display an asocial behavior, digging, and engaged in more digging than XXSry male mice. All of these behaviors were tested in gonadectomized adults, thus, differences in circulating levels of gonadal steroids cannot account for these effects. Taken together, these data show that sex chromosome complement affects social interaction style in mice.
