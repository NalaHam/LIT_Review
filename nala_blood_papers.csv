B. and Gibbons, R. J. and Deville, M. A. and Fisher, C. and Schwabe, M. and Biss√©, E. and van Dorsselaer, A. and Higgs, D. R. and L√ºbbert, M.","Alpha thalassaemia myelodysplastic syndrome (ATMDS) is an unusual complication of chronic myeloid malignancy that is associated with a striking red cell phenotype. It represents an acquired form of alpha-thalassaemia that most commonly arises in the context of myelodysplasia. It has recently been shown that this condition occurs in association with somatic mutations of a known X-encoded trans-acting regulator of alpha globin gene (HBA) expression, ATRX. There is an unexplained, strong male preponderance of individuals with the ATMDS phenotype with a >5:1 male-female ratio and furthermore, all the somatic ATRX mutations described to date have been in males. Here we report the identification, in a single centre, of two females with ATMDS and mutations in the ATRX gene, proving that ATMDS associated with such mutations may occur, albeit rarely, in females. It seemed possible that females might be less likely to develop ATMDS if the inactivated copy of the ATRX gene (ATRX) became progressively re-activated throughout life. This study ruled out this hypothesis by investigating the pattern of ATRX inactivation in a cross-sectional analysis of normal females at ages ranging from newborn to 90 years.","experiment","ATRX","x","","","EXCI","alpha thalassaemia myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloid malignancy, ","case study","","","","","very relevant"

C. and Chen, X. and Prien, C. and Borja, M. S. and Hammerson, B. and Oda, M. N. and Arnold, A. P. and Reue, K.","Objective - The molecular mechanisms underlying sex differences in dyslipidemia are poorly understood. We aimed to distinguish genetic and hormonal regulators of sex differences in plasma lipid levels. Approach and Results - We assessed the role of gonadal hormones and sex chromosome complement on lipid levels using the four core genotypes mouse model (XX females, XX males, XY females, and XY males). In gonadally intact mice fed a chow diet, lipid levels were influenced by both male-female gonadal sex and XX-XY chromosome complement. Gonadectomy of adult mice revealed that the male-female differences are dependent on acute effects of gonadal hormones. In both intact and gonadectomized animals, XX mice had higher HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than XY mice, regardless of male-female sex. Feeding a cholesterol-enriched diet produced distinct patterns of sex differences in lipid levels compared with a chow diet, revealing the interaction of gonadal and chromosomal sex with diet. Notably, under all dietary and gonadal conditions, HDL-C levels were higher in mice with 2 X chromosomes compared with mice with an X and Y chromosome. By generating mice with XX, XY, and XXY chromosome complements, we determined that the presence of 2 X chromosomes, and not the absence of the Y chromosome, influences HDL-C concentration. Conclusions - We demonstrate that having 2 X chromosomes versus an X and Y chromosome complement drives sex differences in HDL-C. It is conceivable that increased expression of genes escaping X-inactivation in XX mice regulates downstream processes to establish sexual dimorphism in plasma lipid levels.","experiment","","x","","","plasma lipid levels","dyslipidemia","","","","","","We demonstrate that having 2 X chromosomes versus an X and Y chromosome complement drives sex differences in HDL-C.

B. and Lubahn, D. B. and Lord, S. T. and Kirshtein, J. and Nilsson, I. M. and Wallmark, A. and Ljung, R. and Frazier, L. D. and Ware, J. L. and Lin, S. W. and et al.","A mouse monoclonal antibody (MAB 9.9) to coagulation factor IX (F.IX) detects a polymorphism in the plasma of normal people. Its epitope has been narrowed down to less than 6 amino acids in the activation peptide of the X-linked F.IX protein. The activation peptide contains a dimorphism--Thr:Ala--at position 148 of the protein. Using synthetic oligonucleotides, we have demonstrated that (1) the F.IX which reacts with 9.9 has Thr at position 148 and (2) that which does not has Ala. Positive reactors (148thr) are designated Malm√∂ A, and negative reactors (148ala) are designated Malm√∂ B. The plasma levels of AA women are indistinguishable from those of A men, and both B men and BB women are null against MAB 9.9. The plasma level of Malm√∂ A in AB women is approximately half that of AA women, and ""lyonization"" is clearly operating in the heterozygotes. The dimorphism is in strong linkage disequilibrium with two other intragenic RFLPs, TaqI and XmnI. Furthermore, intragenic crossing-over--including double crossing-over--appears to have occurred between the three sites. Seven of the eight possible haplotypes have been identified, five in men and two others in women. The immunoassay that identifies approximately 50% of the AB women in the pool of Malm√∂ A females with 95% confidence identifies men unambiguously as A or B. The assay would be very useful for population-genetic studies of the Malm√∂ epitope if the studies were limited to men.","experiment","x","","","","","plasma","","","","x","",""

H. and Stormorken, H. and Sparr, T.","A 28 year old pregnant women was referred for genetic counselling because of a bleeding tendency and a family history of hemophilia. The hemophilia patients had 0.02 units/ml of factor IX activity and a normal concentration of factor IX antigen. In addition they had a proloned coagulation time with bovine thromboplastin and were therefore cases of hemophilia B(M). At the age of six the patient was hosptialized because of prolonged bleeding after a tooth extraction. At the age of 20 and 24 she gave birth to healthy daughters. The first delivery was complicated by a serious bleeding seven days post partum whereas the second delivery was without complications. Factor IX activity when she was three months pregnant was 0.02-0.03 units/ml and the factor IX antigen concentration was normal. Coagulation time with bovine thromboplastin was prolonged. Delivery was again normal, and she had a daughter with carrier values of factor IX. Her mother also had carrier values whereas her father was normal. The patient's hemophilia B(M) was probably due to extreme Lyonization in a heterozygote.","experiment","","","","","lyonization","hemophilia","","case study","","","x",""

M.","The genetic basis of haemophilia A (HA) is well-established, and many haematology services are supported by molecular biology laboratories that offer factor VIII genetic testing for HA patients. This report describes the results from factor VIII gene (F8) analysis of a New Zealand cohort of 45 proband HA patients. We screened all proband HA patients attending local clinics to determine the molecular basis of disease in each case. We also aimed to evaluate the significance of founder effect in this population and to explain an unusual case of HA in a female patient. HA patients were screened for the common F8 gene inversion mutations using previously described PCR-based techniques, and for single base substitution mutations using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and DNA sequencing. Analysis of microsatellite markers located within or near F8 was used to determine identity by descent and trace inheritance patterns of disease alleles. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) patterns were detected using methylation specific PCR. Pathogenic F8 gene mutations were detected in all 45 HA patients in this cohort and non-random XCI was confirmed in a female haemophiliac. We report nine novel F8 mutations, including two splicing mutations, a five nucleotide deletion and a large deletion at the 5‚Ä≤ end of the gene. The molecular aetiology of HA was similar to that described in other studies but the distribution of mutations was unusual due to founder effects, with almost a quarter of all probands being descended from just three individuals. ¬© 2007 The Authors Journal compliation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","experiment","F8","","","","","haemophilia a","","","","x","",""
