In this report, we estimate the number of functional retrogenes on the lineage leading to humans generated by the high rate of retroposition (retroduplication) in primates. Extensive comparative sequencing and expression studies coupled with evolutionary analyses and simulations suggest that a significant proportion of recent retrocopies represent bona fide human genes. We estimate that at least one new retrogene per million years emerged on the human lineage during the past approximately 63 million years of primate evolution. Detailed analysis of a subset of the data shows that the majority of retrogenes are specifically expressed in testis, whereas their parental genes show broad expression patterns. Consistently, most retrogenes evolved functional roles in spermatogenesis. Proteins encoded by X chromosome-derived retrogenes were strongly preserved by purifying selection following the duplication event, supporting the view that they may act as functional autosomal substitutes during X-inactivation of late spermatogenesis genes. Also, some retrogenes acquired a new or more adapted function driven by positive selection. We conclude that retroduplication significantly contributed to the formation of recent human genes and that most new retrogenes were progressively recruited during primate evolution by natural and/or sexual selection to enhance male germline function.","1545-7885 Marques, Ana Claudia Dupanloup, Isabelle Vinckenbosch, Nicolas Reymond, Alexandre Kaessmann, Henrik Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2005/10/06 PLoS Biol. 2005 Nov;3(11):e357. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030357.

To test the impact of Xist RNA on X-linked gene silencing, we ectopically induced endogenous Xist by ablating the antisense repressor Tsix in mice. We find that ectopic Xist RNA induction and subsequent X-linked gene silencing is sex specific in embryos and in differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). A higher frequency of XΔTsixY male cells displayed ectopic Xist RNA coating compared with XΔTsixX female cells. This increase reflected the inability of XΔTsixY cells to efficiently silence X-linked genes compared with XΔTsixX cells, despite equivalent Xist RNA induction and coating. Silencing of genes on both Xs resulted in significantly reduced proliferation and increased cell death in XΔTsixX female cells relative to XΔTsixY male cells. Thus, whereas Xist RNA can inactivate the X chromosome in females it may not do so in males. We further found comparable silencing in differentiating XΔTsixY and 39,XΔTsix (XΔTsixO) ESCs, excluding the Y chromosome and instead implicating the X-chromosome dose as the source of the sex-specific differences. Because XΔTsixX female embryonic epiblast cells and EpiSCs harbor an inactivated X chromosome prior to ectopic inactivation of the active XΔTsix X chromosome, we propose that the increased expression of one or more X-inactivation escapees activates Xist and, separately, helps trigger X-linked gene silencing.","L607777351 2016-01-26 2016-02-02","10.1073/pnas.1515971113","protein;RNA;unclassified drug;X inactive specific transcript protein;animal experiment;article;cell death;controlled study;ectoderm;embryonic stem cell;epiblast stem cell;epigenetics;female;gene silencing;genetic variability;male;mouse;nonhuman;priority journal;sex difference;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation",NA,NA

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to confirm a role for XCI skewing as a potential explanation for the strong female preponderance seen in AITD. DESIGN: The design of the study was to screen XCI in the largest GD, HT, and control case-control cohort and family cohort to date and undertake a meta-analysis of previous AITD XCI reports. SETTING: The study was conducted at a research laboratory. PATIENTS: Three hundred and nine GD, 490 HT, and 325 female UK Caucasians controls, 273 UK Caucasian GD families, and a meta-analysis of 454 GD, 673 HT, and 643 female Caucasian controls were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Case-control and family-based association studies and meta-analysis were measured. RESULTS: Skewed XCI was observed with GD [odds ratio (OR) 2.17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-3.30], P=2.1×10(-4)] and a trend toward skewing with HT (P=.08) compared with the control cohort. A meta-analysis of our UK data and that of four previous non-UK Caucasian studies confirmed significant skewing of XCI with GD [OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.58-4.10), P=1.0×10(-4), I2=30.2%] and HT [OR 2.40 (95% CI 1.10-5.26), P=.03, I2=74.3%]. CONCLUSIONS: Convincing evidence exists to support a role for skewed XCI in female subjects with AITD, which may, in part, explain the strong female preponderance observed in this disease.","1945-7197 Simmonds, Matthew J Kavvoura, Fotini K Brand, Oliver J Newby, Paul R Jackson, Laura E Hargreaves, Chantal E Franklyn, Jayne A Gough, Stephen C L 068181/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom Journal Article Meta-Analysis Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2013/11/05 J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2014 Jan;99(1):E127-31. doi: 10.1210/jc.2013-2667.

M. and Doumbo, O. K. and Wellems, T. E. and Diallo, D. A.","",NA,NA,NA,"BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is important in the control of oxidant stress in erythrocytes, the host cells for Plasmodium falciparum. Mutations in this enzyme produce X-linked deficiency states associated with protection against malaria, notably in Africa where the A- form of G6PD deficiency is widespread. Some reports have proposed that heterozygous females with mosaic populations of normal and deficient erythrocytes (due to random X chromosome inactivation) have malaria resistance similar to or greater than hemizygous males with populations of uniformly deficient erythrocytes. These proposals are paradoxical, and they are not consistent with currently hypothesized mechanisms of protection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted large case-control studies of the A- form of G6PD deficiency in cases of severe or uncomplicated malaria among two ethnic populations of rural Mali, West Africa, where malaria is hyperendemic. Our results indicate that the uniform state of G6PD deficiency in hemizygous male children conferred significant protection against severe, life-threatening malaria, and that it may have likewise protected homozygous female children. No such protection was evident from the mosaic state of G6PD deficiency in heterozygous females. We also found no significant differences in the parasite densities of males and females with differences in G6PD status. Pooled odds ratios from meta-analysis of our data and data from a previous study confirmed highly significant protection against severe malaria in hemizygous males but not in heterozygous females. Among the different forms of severe malaria, protection was principally evident against cerebral malaria, the most frequent form of life-threatening malaria in these studies. CONCLUSIONS: The A- form of G6PD deficiency in Africa is under strong natural selection from the preferential protection it provides to hemizygous males against life-threatening malaria. Little or no such protection is present among heterozygous females. Although these conclusions are consistent with data from at least one previous study, they have not heretofore been realized to our knowledge, and they therefore give fresh perspectives on malaria protection by G6PD deficiency as an X-linked trait.","1549-1676 Guindo, Aldiouma Fairhurst, Rick M Doumbo, Ogobara K Wellems, Thomas E Diallo, Dapa A Intramural NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural United States 2007/03/16 PLoS Med. 2007 Mar;4(3):e66. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0040066.","10.1371/journal.pmed.0040066","Alleles;Case-Control Studies;Child;Child, Preschool;Chromosomes, Human, X/genetics;Female;Genes, X-Linked;Genetic Diseases, X-Linked/*genetics;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/genetics;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency/*genetics;Heterozygote;Humans;*Immunity, Innate;Malaria/*immunology;Male;Mali/epidemiology;*Selection, Genetic;Sex Factors;Malaria",NA,NA

Although small in number, imprinted genes can profoundly influence key developmental and physiological processes, including those in the brain; work in animal models and in humans has shown that such genes can affect behavioral traits and cognition and may confer vulnerability to common mental illnesses. As a consequence of how the X chromosome is inherited, X-linked imprinting may elicit or indeed attenuate sexually dimorphic phenotypes.

However, only a few single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the X chromosome have been found to be associated with diseases. Compared to the autosomes, conducting association tests on the X chromosome is more intractable due to the difference in the number of X chromosomes between females and males. On the other hand, X-chromosome inactivation takes place in female mammals, which is a phenomenon in which the expression of one copy of two X chromosomes in females is silenced in order to achieve the same gene expression level as that in males. In addition, imprinting effects may be related to certain diseases. Currently, there are some existing approaches taking X-chromosome inactivation into account when testing for associations on the X chromosome. However, none of them allows for imprinting effects. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a robust test, ZXCII, which accounts for both X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting effects without requiring specifying the genetic models in advance. Simulation studies are conducted in order to investigate the validity and performance of ZXCII under various scenarios of different parameter values. The simulation results show that ZXCII controls the type I error rate well when there is no association. Furthermore, with regards to power, ZXCII is robust in all of the situations considered and generally outperforms most of the existing methods in the presence of imprinting effects, especially under complete imprinting effects.","1469-5073 Zhang, Yu Xu, Si-Qi Liu, Wei Fung, Wing Kam Zhou, Ji-Yuan Orcid: 0000-0003-0866-4402 Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2020/04/03 Genet Res (Camb). 2020 Apr 1;102:e2. doi: 10.1017/S0016672320000026.","10.1017/s0016672320000026","Algorithms;Chromosomes, Human, X/*genetics;*Computer Simulation;Female;*Genetic Association Studies;Genetic Testing/*methods;*Genomic Imprinting;Humans;Male;Models, Genetic;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;*X Chromosome Inactivation;X chromosome;association test;imprinting effects;inactivation;X Chromosome",NA,NA

One of the major shared features among AID is the predominance in the female sex which in some cases changes with the age at disease diagnosis. Numerous hypotheses have been formulated based on intuitive scientific backgrounds to justify this sex imbalance, i.e. sex hormones and reproductive factors, fetal microchimerism, other sex-related environmental factors, a skewing of the X-chromosome inactivation patterns, and major defects in sex chromosomes. Nevertheless, none of these hypotheses has thus far gathered enough convincing evidence and in most cases data are conflicting, as well illustrated by the reports on fetal microchimerism in systemic sclerosis or primary biliary cirrhosis. The present article will critically discuss the main hypotheses (loss of mosaicism, reactivation, and haploinsufficiency) that have been proposed based on findings in female patients with specific AID along with two additional mechanisms (X-chromosome vulnerability and X-linked polyamine genes) that have been observed in AID models. Further, recent data have significantly shifted the paradigm of X chromosome inactivation by demonstrating that a large number of genes can variably escape silencing on one or both chromosomes. As a result we may hypothesize that more than one mechanism may contribute to the female susceptibility to tolerance breakdown while the possibility that unknown factors may indeed protect men from AID should not be overlooked.","1873-0183 Selmi, Carlo Brunetta, Enrico Raimondo, Maria Gabriella Meroni, Pier Luigi Journal Article Review Netherlands 2011/12/14 Autoimmun Rev. 2012 May;11(6-7):A531-7. doi: 10.1016/j.autrev.2011.11.024.

Nevertheless, other organ specific autoimmune diseases (i.e. ulcerative colitis) are seemingly characterized with similar prevalence in both males and females. The reason for gender differences in certain autoimmune diseases remains unknown, but may be attributed to sex hormone influence, fetal microchimerism, X chromosome inactivation, and X chromosome abnormalities. Sex hormones have been found to have immune modulating properties, as well as providing cellular protection following tissue damage in certain circumstances. Sex hormones also influence innate and adaptive immune cells, number of B and T cells, antigen presentation and cytokine secretion. Herein, we review the influence of gender on organ-specific autoimmune diseases affecting the heart, blood vessels, central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. It appears that sex hormones may have a therapeutic potential in several autoimmune conditions, although further research is required before therapeutic recommendations can be made. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","L51730252 2011-11-29 2012-03-28","10.1016/j.autrev.2011.11.001","colecalciferol;cytokine;estriol;estrogen;estrogen receptor;gestagen;oral contraceptive agent;prasterone;progesterone;recombinant interleukin 10;sex hormone;testosterone;age;atherosclerosis;autoimmune disease;autoimmunity;cardiovascular risk;celiac disease;central nervous system;congestive cardiomyopathy;congestive heart failure;Crohn disease;cytokine production;disease course;disease predisposition;drug megadose;estrogen therapy;gender;Guillain Barre syndrome;heart failure;human;immunomodulation;incidence;long term care;multiple sclerosis;myasthenia gravis;myocarditis;neuroprotection;nonhuman;peripheral vascular disease;review;rheumatic fever;risk factor;sex difference;cerebrovascular accident;ulcerative colitis;Organ Specificity",NA,NA

Using these novel data, we elucidate divergent versus common features of representative marsupial and eutherian DNA methylation. First, tissue-specific differential DNA methylation in koalas primarily occurs in gene bodies. Second, females show significant global reduction (hypomethylation) of X chromosome DNA methylation compared to males. We show that this pattern is also observed in eutherians. Third, on average, promoter DNA methylation shows little difference between male and female koala X chromosomes, a pattern distinct from that of eutherians. Fourth, the sex-specific DNA methylation landscape upstream of Rsx, the primary lncRNA associated with marsupial XCI, is consistent with the epigenetic regulation of female-specific (and presumably inactive X chromosome-specific) expression. Finally, we use the prominent female X chromosome hypomethylation and classify 98 previously unplaced scaffolds as X-linked, contributing an additional 14.6 Mb (21.5%) to genomic data annotated as the koala X chromosome.

Using high-depth RNA sequencing (>50 million reads/sample) to pinpoint sexually dimorphic changes related to regeneration, immune response, bioenergy, and sensory functions, we identified a higher number of transcriptional changes in male relative to female DRG.

A. and Bourke, N. M. and O'Farrelly, C.","",NA,NA,NA,"Type I interferons (IFN-I) and their cognate receptor, the IFNAR1/2 heterodimer, are critical components of the innate immune system in humans. They have been widely explored in the context of viral infection and autoimmune disease where they play key roles in protection against infection or shaping disease pathogenesis. A false dichotomy has emerged in the study of IFN-I where interferons are thought of as either beneficial or pathogenic. This 'good or bad' viewpoint excludes more nuanced interpretations of IFN-I biology - for example, it is known that IFN-I is associated with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, yet is also protective in the context of infectious diseases and contributes to resistance to viral infection. Studies have suggested that a shared transcriptomic signature underpins both potential resistance to viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmune disease. This seems to be particularly evident in females, who exhibit increased viral resistance and increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease. The molecular mechanisms behind such a signature and the role of sex in its determination have yet to be precisely defined. From a genomic perspective, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFN-I pathway have been associated with both infectious and autoimmune disease. While overlap between infection and autoimmunity has been described in the incidence of these SNPs, it has been overlooked in work and discussion to date. Here, we discuss the possible contributions of IFN-Is to the pathogenesis of infectious and autoimmune diseases. We comment on genetic associations between common SNPs in IFN-I or their signalling molecules that point towards roles in protection against viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmunity and propose that a shared transcriptomic and genomic immunological signature may underlie resistance to viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmunity in humans.

Various factors play a role in this, and novel studies suggest that the gene-dose of Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 7 could contribute to the sex-skewed severity. TLR7 is one of the crucial pattern recognition receptors for SARS-CoV-2 ssRNA and the gene-dose effect is caused by X chromosome inactivation (XCI) escape. Female immune cells with TLR7 XCI escape have biallelic TLR7 expression and produce more type 1 interferon (IFN) upon TLR7 stimulation. In COVID-19, TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is one of the pattern recognition receptors responsible for IFN production and a delayed IFN response has been associated with immunopathogenesis and mortality. Here, we provide a hypothesis that females may be protected to some extend against severe COVID-19, due to the biallelic TLR7 expression, allowing them to mount a stronger and more protective IFN response early after infection.

However, IFN-I-signaling has been shown to play opposite effects in HIV-1 and SIV infection. TLR7-driven type I interferon production in pDCs is higher in women than in men due to the cell-intrinsic actions of estrogen and X-chromosome complement. Indeed, TLR7 is encoded on the X-chromosome, and the TLR7 gene escapes the X-chromosome inactivation in immune cells of women which express significantly higher levels of TLR7 protein than male cells. Following HIV infection, women have a lower viremia during acute infection and exhibit stronger antiviral responses than men, which has been attributed to the increased capacity of female pDCs to produce IFN-α upon TLR7-stimulation. However, a deleterious functional impact of an excessive TLR7 response on acute viremia in women has been recently revealed by the analysis of the frequent rs179008 c.32A>T SNP of TLR7. This SNP was identified as a sex-specific protein abundance quantitative trait locus (pQTL) causing a difference in the TLR7 protein dosage and effector function in females only. T allele expression was associated with a lower TLR7 protein synthesis, blunted production of IFN-α by pDCs upon TLR7 stimulation, and an unexpectedly lower viral load during primary HIV-1 infection in women.

Together, these trends indicate that females have a heightened immune reactogenicity to both self and non-self-molecular patterns. However, the molecular mechanisms driving the sexually dimorphic immune response are not fully understood. The female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, as well as the male androgens, such as testosterone, elicit direct effects on the function and inflammatory capacity of immune cells. Several studies have identified a sex-specific transcriptome and methylome, independent of the well-described phenomenon of X-chromosome inactivation, suggesting that sexual dimorphism also occurs at the epigenetic level. Moreover, distinct alterations to the transcriptome and epigenetic landscape occur in synchrony with periods of hormonal change, such as puberty, pregnancy, menopause, and exogenous hormone therapy. These changes are also mirrored by changes in immune cell function. This review will outline the evidence for sex hormones and pregnancy-associated hormones as drivers of epigenetic change, and how this may contribute to the sexual dimorphism.

Males who are hemizygous for mutant MECP2 are more severely affected than heterozygous females and rarely survive. Mecp2 loss-of-function is less severe in mice, however, and male hemizygous null mice not only survive until adulthood, they have been the most commonly studied model system.

We find that Xist RNA becomes increasingly mislocalized from the Xi with disease onset. While NZB/W F1 naïve B cells have H3K27me3 foci on the Xi, which are missing from healthy C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, these foci are progressively lost in stimulated B cells during disease. Using single-molecule RNA FISH, we show that the X-linked gene Tlr7 is biallelically expressed in ~20% of NZB/W F1 B cells, and that the amount of biallelic expression does not change with disease. We also present sex-specific gene expression profiles for diseased NZB/W F1 B cells, and find female-specific upregulation of 20 genes, including the autoimmunity-related genes Cxcl13, Msr1, Igj, and Prdm1.

Using a novel pipeline on those data, we identified a decrease in the proportion of biallelically expressed X-linked genes during development, consistent with XCI. Moreover, we show that while the expression sum of biallelically expressed X-linked genes decreases with embryonic development, their median expression remains constant, rejecting the hypothesis of X dampening. In addition, analyses of a different dataset of scRNA-seq suggest the appearance of X-linked monoallelic expression by the late blastocyst stage in females, another hallmark of initiation of XCI. Finally, we addressed the issue of dosage compensation between the single active X and autosomes in males and females for the first time during human preimplantation development, showing emergence of X to autosome dosage compensation by the upregulation of the active X chromosome in both male and female embryonic stem cells.

Using the X chromosome in the sexually dimorphic mouse liver as a model, we provide a general framework for comparing base-resolution DNA methylation patterns across samples that have different chromosome numbers and ask at a systematic level if predictions by historical analyses of X-linked DNA methylation hold true at a base-resolution chromosome-wide level. We demonstrate that sex-specific methylation patterns on the X chromosome largely reflect the effects of XCI. While our observations concur with longstanding observations of XCI at promoter-proximal CpG islands, we provide evidence that sex-specific DNA methylation differences are not limited to CpG island boundaries. Moreover, these data support a model in which maintenance of CpG islands in the inactive state does not require complete regional methylation.

Most of the sexually dimorphic phenotypes correlated with the presence of ovaries or testes and therefore reflect the hormonal output of the gonads.

Here, we examined the relationship between the length of the CAG-repeat in AR and different handedness phenotypes in a sample of healthy adults of both sexes (n = 1057). Since AR is located on the X chromosome, statistical analyses in women heterozygous for CAG-repeat lengths are complicated by X chromosome inactivation. We thus analyzed a sample of women that were homozygous for the CAG-repeat length (n = 77). Mixed-handedness in men was significantly associated with longer CAG-repeat blocks and women homozygous for longer CAG-repeats showed a tendency for stronger left-handedness. These results suggest that handedness in both sexes is associated with the AR CAG-repeat length, with longer repeats being related to a higher incidence of non-right-handedness.

To address this, we developed a systematic map of SCD effects on gene function by analyzing genome-wide expression data in humans with diverse sex-chromosome aneuploidies (XO, XXX, XXY, XYY, and XXYY). For sex chromosomes, we demonstrate a pattern of obligate dosage sensitivity among evolutionarily preserved X-Y homologs and update prevailing theoretical models for SCD compensation by detecting X-linked genes that increase expression with decreasing X-and/or Y-chromosome dosage. We further show that SCD-sensitive sex-chromosome genes regulate specific coexpression networks of SCD-sensitive autosomal genes with critical cellular functions and a demonstrable potential to mediate previously documented SCD effects on disease. These gene coexpression results converge with analysis of transcription factor binding site enrichment and measures of gene expression in murine knockout models to spotlight the dosage-sensitive X-linked transcription factor ZFX as a key mediator of SCD effects on wider genome expression. Our findings characterize the effects of SCD broadly across the genome, with potential implications for human phenotypic variation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 72 Total Times Cited: 72 Cited Reference Count: 32","10.1073/pnas.1802889115","sex chromosomes;X-inactivation;sex differences;Turner syndrome;Klinefelter syndrome;X-CHROMOSOME;Y-CHROMOSOMES;ZFX CONTROLS;INACTIVATION;COMPENSATION;TISSUES;SYSTEMS;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Gene Expression;Sex Chromosomes",NA,NA

However, there is, at present, little evidence to suggest that most X chromosome-linked genes require such compensation. Another view - that X chromosome inactivation may be related to sex determination - is examined here. Consider a hypothetical DNA sequence regulating a major structural gene concerned with the determination of maleness. If this regulatory sequence occurs in both X and Y chromosomes and if its copy number in the Y chromosome is significantly greater than in the X chromosome, then the male-determining properties of the Y chromosome could be attributed to this higher copy number. On the other hand, if the Y chromosome has the same copy number of this sequence as the X chromosome, it is difficult to see how determination of two sexes would occur under such circumstances because XX and XY genomes would then be indistinguishable in this regard. Such a situation seems to occur in the human species with respect to the banded krait minor satellite, a repetitious DNA sequence associated with sex determination. This apparent difficulty may be resolved if X chromosome inactivation renders regulatory as well as structural genes nonfunctional and thereby brings about a significant reduction in the effective copy number of X chromosome-linked DNA sequences concerned with sex determination. It is suggested that X chromosome inactivation brings about, in this manner, a critical inequality between XX and XY embryos and that sex determination in humans is a consequence of this inequality. An analogous situation appears to exist in certain insects in which inactivation of a haploid set of chromosomes (and presumably, therefore, a 50% reduction in the effective copy number of most genes) is associated with maleness. If this line of reasoning is correct, it would suggest that sex determination may be the primary function of X chromosome inactivation.","L16209671 1986-04-02","10.1073/pnas.82.20.6947","age;developmental genetics;embryo;female genital system;gene expression regulation;heredity;heterochromatin;human;male genital system;mammal;normal human;priority journal;sex determination;sex difference;theoretical study;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Chromosomes, Human, X;X Chromosome",NA,NA

However, the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory factors contribute to sex-specific valve fibro-calcification remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified inflammatory factors present in serum samples from AVS patients that regulate sex-specific myofibroblast activation and osteoblast-like differentiation.

Additionally, annexin A2 and cystatin C increase osteoblast-like differentiation primarily in male VICs. Our results implicate serum inflammatory factors as potential AVS biomarkers that also contribute to sexually dimorphic AVS progression by driving VIC myofibroblast activation and/or osteoblast-like differentiation.

To define the role of DNA methylation in maintenance of X chromosome inactivity, we examined loci for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase in a North American marsupial, the opossum Didelphis virginiana, by using genomic hybridization probes cloned from this species. We find that these marsupial genes are like their eutherian counterparts, with respect to sex differences in methylation of nuclease-insensitive (nonregulatory) chromatin. However, with respect to methylation of the nuclease-hypersensitive (regulatory) chromatin of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase locus, the opossum gene differs from those of eutherians, as the 5' cluster of CpG dinucleotides is hypomethylated in the paternal as well as the maternal gene. Despite hypomethylation of the 5' CpG cluster, the paternal allele, identified by an enzyme variant, is at best partially expressed; therefore, factors other than methylation are responsible for repression. In light of these results, it seems that the role of DNA methylation in eutherian X dosage compensation is to ""lock in"" the process initiated by such factors. Because of similarities between dosage compensation in marsupials and trophectoderm derivatives of eutherians, we propose that differences in timing of developmental events--rather than differences in the basic mechanisms of X inactivation--account for features of dosage compensation that differ among mammals.","L17785443 1987-10-05","10.1073/pnas.84.17.6210","DNA;animal;article;chromatin;comparative study;female;gene expression regulation;genetics;human;male;metabolism;methylation;nucleotide sequence;opossum;species difference;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;X Chromosome;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA Methylation",NA,NA

We identified the genomic dosage of Kdm5c, an X chromosome gene that escapes X chromosome inactivation, as a determinant of the X chromosome effect on adiposity. Modulating Kdm5c gene dosage in XX female mice to levels that are normally present in males resulted in reduced body weight, fat content, and food intake to a degree similar to that seen with altering the entire X chromosome dosage.

Both in vitro and in vivo, Kdm5c dosage influenced gene expression involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, which is critical for adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue expansion. In humans, adipose tissue KDM5C mRNA levels and KDM5C genetic variants were associated with body mass.

We analyzed methylation signals across CpG sites mapped to each X-linked gene using an unsupervised classifier (principal components) followed by an internal evaluation and an exhaustive cross-validation.

X-linked genes with significant sex-based differential methylation in the nasal airway of infants represented only about 50% of the unique protein coding transcripts. X-linked genes without significant sex-based differential methylation included genes with evidence of escaping X-inactivation and female-biased airway expression. These genes showed similar methylation patterns in males and females suggesting unbalanced X-chromosome dosage.

The transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome achieves dosage compensation between XX females and XY males and ensures equal expression of X-linked genes in both sexes. Although all mammals use this form of dosage compensation, the complex mechanisms that regulate XCI vary between species, tissues, and development. These mechanisms include not only varying levels of inactivation, but also the nature of inactivation, which can range from being random in nature to driven by parent of origin. To date, no data describing XCI in calves or adult cattle have been reported and we are reliant on data from mice to infer potential mechanisms and timings for this process. In the context of dairy cattle breeding and genomic prediction, the implications of X chromosome inheritance and XCI in the mammary gland are particularly important where a relatively small number of bulls pass their single X chromosome on to all of their daughters. We describe here the use of RNA-seq, whole genome sequencing and Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) genotypes to assess XCI in lactating mammary glands of dairy cattle. At a population level, maternally and paternally inherited copies of the X chromosome are expressed equally in the lactating mammary gland consistent with random inactivation of the X chromosome. However, average expression of the paternal chromosome ranged from 10 to 90% depending on the individual animal. These results suggest that either the mammary gland arises from 1 or 2 stem cells, or a nongenetic mechanism that skews XCI exists. Although a considerable amount of future work is required to fully understand XCI in cattle, the data reported here represent an initial step in ensuring that X chromosome variation is captured and used in an appropriate manner for future genomic selection.","L622398426 2018-06-05","10.3168/jds.2016-12490","animal;bovine;female;gene expression regulation;genetics;lactation;male;sex factor;udder;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome",NA,NA

PLS3 is localized on the X-chromosome, but shows sex-specific, inter-individual and tissue-specific expression variability pointing towards skewed X-inactivation. PLS3 is expressed in all solid tissues but usually not in hematopoietic cells. When escaping X-inactivation, PLS3 triggers a plethora of different types of cancers. Elevated PLS3 levels are considered a prognostic biomarker for cancer and refractory response to therapies. When it is knocked out or mutated in humans and mice, it causes osteoporosis with bone fractures; it is the only protein involved in actin dynamics responsible for osteoporosis. Instead, when PLS3 is upregulated, it acts as a highly protective SMN-independent modifier in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Here, it seems to counteract reduced F-actin levels by restoring impaired endocytosis and disturbed calcium homeostasis caused by reduced SMN levels. In contrast, an upregulation of PLS3 on wild-type level might cause osteoarthritis. This emphasizes that the amount of PLS3 in our cells must be precisely balanced; both too much and too little can be detrimental.

To determine if methylation has a role in maintaining inactivity of X-linked genes which show tissue-specific expression, we examined the locus for blood clotting Factor IX. The analysis encompassed 91% of the HpaII and HhaI sites in the 41-kb region that includes the presumed promoter region, 5 kb of 5'- and 4 kb of 3'-flanking sequences. Although there are sex differences in methylation of the locus in leukocytes, the methylation pattern in liver, where the gene is expressed, is essentially the same for loci on the active and inactive X chromosome. The lack of differences in methylation of active and inactive genes makes it unlikely that methylation within the locus has a role in expression of the Factor IX gene. These findings, along with the absence of clustered CpG dinucleotides within the Factor IX locus, suggest that functional differences in DNA methylation related to X chromosome dosage compensation may be limited to CpG clusters. In any event, dosage compensation seems to be maintained regionally, rather than locus by locus.","L16779599 1986-12-19","","blood clotting factor 9;article;female;fibroblast;gene;genetic transcription;genetics;human;leukocyte;liver;lymphocyte;male;metabolism;methylation;placenta;pregnancy;restriction fragment length polymorphism;sexual development;X chromosome;Humanities;Humanism;Humans",NA,NA

Three TBG-CDJ heterozygotes and one unaffected female, confirmed to be PGK heterozygotes for a polymorphic BstXI site, were analyzed. Only the CD female was shown to undergo selective inactivation by examining the BstXI site in amplified products after digestion with a methylation sensitive enzyme, HpaII. Among an additional eight informative females with TBG deficiency, one heterozygous female for TBG-PDJ shared this selective inactivation pattern. Moreover, the X-chromosome with TBG-C was suggested to be inactivated selectively from the linkage of PGK and TBG alleles recognized in eight of nine family members. Selective X-chromosome inactivation was considered to be the cause of a female heterozygous for TBG- CDJ or -PDJ manifesting the same phenotype as a hemizygote.","L26176710 1996-06-24","10.1210/jc.81.6.2204","thyroxine binding globulin;article;chromosome Xq;clinical article;controlled study;female;genetic linkage;genotype;hormone deficiency;human;human cell;human tissue;molecular genetics;phenotype;priority journal;sex difference;thyroxine binding globulin deficiency;X chromosome inactivation;Thyroxine;Dextrothyroxine;Immunoglobulins, Intravenous;X Chromosome;Phenotype;Genotype",NA,NA

Various factors, including sex hormones, the presence or absence of a second X chromosome, and sex-specific gut microbiota can influence gene expression in a sex-specific way. These changes in gene expression may, in turn, lead to susceptibility or protection from autoimmunity, creating a sex bias for autoimmune diseases.

Chromosome X open reading frame 21 (CXorf21) escapes X-inactivation and is an SLE risk gene of previously unknown function. We undertook the present study to delineate the function of CXorf21 in the immune system as well as investigate a potential role in the sex bias of SLE and pSS. Methods: Western blot protein analysis, qPCR, BioPlex cytokine immunoassay, pHrodo™ assays, as well as in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments were employed to delineate the role of CXorf21 in relevant immunocytes. Results: Expressed in monocytes and B cells, CXorf21 basal Mrna, and protein expression levels are elevated in female primary monocytes, B cells, and EBV-transformed B cells compared to male cells. We also found CXorf21 mRNA and protein expression is higher in both male and female cells from SLE patients compared to control subjects. TLR7 ligation increased CXorf21 protein expression and CXorf21 knockdown abrogated TLR7-driven increased IFNA1 mRNA expression, and reduced secretion of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 in healthy female monocytes. Similarly, we found increased pH in the lysosomes of CXorf21-deficient female monocytes. Conclusion: CXorf21 is more highly expressed in female compared to male cells and is involved in a sexually dimorphic response to TLR7 activation. In addition, CXorf21 expression regulates lysosomal pH in a sexually dimorphic manner. Thus, sexually dimorphic expression of CXorf21 skews cellular immune responses in manner consistent with expected properties of a mediator of the X chromosome dose risk in SLE and pSS.","1664-3224 Harris, Valerie M Koelsch, Kristi A Kurien, Biji T Harley, Isaac T W Wren, Jonathan D Harley, John B Scofield, R Hal P30 AR073750/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States T32 AR007534/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States U19 AI082714/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States U54 GM104938/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

Blood samples were incubated with synthetic TLR7 and TLR9 ligands. In three independent groups (n1 = 120, n2 = 101, and n3 = 123), analysis revealed a capacity of female PBLs to produce significantly higher IFN-α levels after TLR7 stimulation (p1, < 0.0000001, p2 < 0.0000001, and p3 < 0.0001) compared with male PBLs. In contrast, no sex differences were evident after TLR9 stimulation. TNF-α production after TLR7 stimulation and also total pDC numbers were not different between females and males. X-inactivation escape of the TLR7 gene was investigated in monoclonal B cell lines and, independently, in pDCs after cell sorting and single-cell picking, indicating regular silencing of one TLR7 allele in females. Additionally, exogenous 17β-estrogen and estrogen receptor antagonism did not indicate a significant role on TLR7-induced IFN-α production. Our data reveal for the first time a profound sex-dependent pathway of TLR7-induced IFN-α with higher production in females.

We have utilized this technique to evaluate the behavior of the single X chromosome in oocytes from XO female mice, providing the first observations on segregation of an achiasmate chromosome during mammalian female meiosis and its effect on the meiotic process. As has been described in other species, we found that the univalent chromosome could either segregate as an intact chromosome to one pole or divide equationally at the first meiotic division. Our results also indicate that the presence of a univalent chromosome causes severe meiotic disruption during mammalian meiosis, affecting the alignment and segregation of other chromosomes in the complement. Despite these meiotic abnormalities, the vast majority of oocytes from XO females were able to resume and successfully complete the first meiotic division. This is in contrast to previous studies of male mice with sex chromosome abnormalities where the presence of a univalent acts to arrest meiosis at metaphase of the first meiotic division. This sex-specific difference in the ability of a cell with a univalent chromosome to initiate anaphase suggests that cell cycle central differs between male and female meiosis and that monitoring of meiotic chromosome behavior is less efficient in the female. The combined use of immunofluorescence staining and FISH on intact oocytes has obvious application to the study of meiotic chromosome non-disjunction in the human female. Simultaneous study of the meiotic cell cycle, protein components of the meiotic apparatus, and chromosome-specific behaviors during mammalian female meiosis provides a new approach to defining age-related changes in the meiotic process that result in increased chromosome malsegregation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 124 Total Times Cited: 127 Cited Reference Count: 31","10.1093/hmg/4.11.2007","x-chromosome;mouse;mice;survival;fetuses;Meiosis",NA,NA

Although genes that cause AS are well characterized, people with AS who have similar genetic mutations present with a wide variation in the extent of kidney impairment and age of onset, suggesting the activities of modifier genes. METHODS: We created a cohort of genetically diverse XLAS male and female mice using the Diversity Outbred mouse resource and measured albuminuria, GFR, and gene expression. Using a quantitative trait locus approach, we mapped modifier genes that can best explain the underlying phenotypic variation measured in our diverse population. RESULTS: Genetic analysis identified several loci associated with the variation in albuminuria and GFR, including a locus on the X chromosome associated with X inactivation and a locus on chromosome 2 containing Fmn1. Subsequent analysis of genetically reduced Fmn1 expression in Col4a5 knockout mice showed a decrease in albuminuria, podocyte effacement, and podocyte protrusions in the glomerular basement membrane, which support the candidacy of Fmn1 as a modifier gene for AS. CONCLUSION: With this novel approach, we emulated the variability in the severity of kidney phenotypes found in human patients with Alport Syndrome through albuminuria and GFR measurements. This approach can identify modifier genes in kidney disease that can be used as novel therapeutic targets.","1533-3450 Takemon, Yuka Orcid: 0000-0002-3538-4409 Wright, Valerie Davenport, Bernard Gatti, Daniel M Sheehan, Susan M Letson, Kelsey Savage, Holly S Lennon, Rachel Korstanje, Ron Orcid: 0000-0002-2808-1610 WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom 202860/Z/16/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2021/05/29 J Am Soc Nephrol. 2021 Aug;32(8):1961-1973. doi: 10.1681/ASN.2020060777.

Previous studies of Drosophila melanogaster found a general paucity of male-biased genes on the X chromosome, although this is mainly limited to comparisons of whole flies or body segments containing the reproductive organs. To better understand the chromosomal distribution of sex-biased genes in various tissues, we used a common analysis framework to analyze microarray and RNA sequence data comparing male and female gene expression in individual tissues (brain, Malpighian tubule, and gonads), composite structures (head and gonadectomized carcass), and whole flies. Although there are relatively few sex-biased genes in the brain, there is a strong and highly significant enrichment of male-biased genes on the X chromosome. A weaker enrichment of X-linked male-biased genes is seen in the head, suggesting that most of this signal comes from the brain. In all other tissues, there is either no departure from the random expectation or a significant paucity of male-biased genes on the X chromosome. The brain and head also differ from other tissues in that their male-biased genes are significantly closer to binding sites of the dosage compensation complex. We propose that the interplay of dosage compensation and sex-specific regulation can explain the observed differences between tissues and reconcile disparate results reported in previous studies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 20 Total Times Cited: 20 Cited Reference Count: 70","10.1093/gbe/evv117","transcriptome;brain;sexual dimorphism;sex chromosomes;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION;SEX-CHROMOSOMES;MALE GERMLINE;EVOLUTION;PAUCITY;CHICKEN;DEMASCULINIZATION;POPULATION;ABUNDANCE",NA,NA

Genetic confirmation is performed through haplotyping or detection of disease-specific changes in the DYT3 gene. Objective: To describe the phenotypes and molecular data of 8 symptomatic female patients with XDP from 5 kindreds. Methods: Case series. Results: The average age of onset of symptoms was 52 years (range, 26-75 years). Six of 8 patients had parkinsonism, whereas only 1 had dystonia. The initial symptom was focal tremor or parkinsonism in 4, chorea in 3, and focal dystonia (cervical) in 1. Seven of 8 patients had slow or no progression of their symptoms and required no treatment. The patient with disabling parkinsonism was responsive to carbidopa/levodopa. Seven were heterozygous for the XDP haplotype, whereas 1 was homozygous. Conclusions: The phenotypes of female patients with XDP may include parkinsonism, dystonia, myoclonus, tremor, and chorea. The dystonia, if present, is mild and usually nonprogressive. Similar to men with XDP, parkinsonism is a frequent symptom in women. In contrast to men, affected women have a more benign phenotype, older age of onset, and milder course. Extreme X-inactivation mosaic may be a cause of symptoms in women with XDP, but a homozygously affected woman has also been observed.","L39612960 2005-02-07","10.1001/archneur.61.12.1956","carbidopa;adult;age;aged;article;chorea;clinical article;disease course;dystonia;female;haplotype;heterozygosity;homozygosity;human;molecular biology;myoclonus;parkinsonism;phenotype;priority journal;sex difference;tremor;X chromosome inactivation;X chromosome linked disorder;x linked dystonia parkinsonism;Phenotype;Dystonia",NA,NA

We present two models of maternal inactivation with differential viability in the sexes, one with complete inactivation, and the other with a partial penetrance for inactivation. We show that, provided dominance relations at the imprintable locus are the same in both sexes, a globally stable polymorphism exists for a range of viabilities that is independent of the penetrance of imprinting. The conditions for a polymorphism are the same as in previous models with differential viability in the sexes but without imprinting and in a model of the paternal X-inactivation system in marsupials. The model with incomplete inactivation is used to illustrate the analogy between imprinting and dominance by comparing equilibrium bifurcation plots for fixed values of dominance and penetrance. We also derive a single expression for the dominance parameter that leaves the frequency and stability of equilibria unchanged for all levels of inactivation.

Some have hypothesized that growth strategies differ between the sexes, whereby males prioritize growth whereas females are more responsive to their environment. This review evaluates the role of the placenta in such strategies, focusing on (1) mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in gene expression, (2) the nature and extent of sexual dimorphism in placental gene expression, (3) sexually dimorphic responses to nutrient supply, and (4) sexual dimorphism in morphology and histopathology. The sex chromosomes contribute to sex differences in placental gene expression, and fetal hormones may play a role later in development. Sexually dimorphic placental gene expression may contribute to differences in the prevalence of complications such as preeclampsia, although this link is not clear. Placental responses to nutrient supply frequently show sexual dimorphism, but there is no consistent pattern where one sex is more responsive. There are sex differences in the prevalence of placental histopathologies, and placental changes in pregnancy complications, but also many similarities. Overall, no clear patterns support the hypothesis that females are more responsive to the maternal environment, or that males prioritize growth. While male fetuses are at greater risk of a variety of complications, total prenatal mortality is higher in females, such that males exposed to early insults may be more likely to survive and be observed in studies of adverse outcomes. Going forward, robust statistical approaches to test for sex-dependent effects must be more widely adopted to reduce the incidence of spurious results.","L2014057790 2021-11-02 2022-07-08","10.1007/s43032-021-00780-3","n acetylglucosamine;transcriptome;transferase;adverse outcome;caloric restriction;fetus growth;gene expression;histopathology;human;malnutrition;nonhuman;nutrient availability;nutrient supply;obesity;placenta function;preeclampsia;pregnancy complication;pregnancy diabetes mellitus;prenatal mortality;prevalence;protein restriction;rat model;review;sex chromosome;sex difference;X chromosome inactivation;Placenta",NA,NA

We aimed to distinguish genetic and hormonal regulators of sex differences in plasma lipid levels. Approach and Results - We assessed the role of gonadal hormones and sex chromosome complement on lipid levels using the four core genotypes mouse model (XX females, XX males, XY females, and XY males). In gonadally intact mice fed a chow diet, lipid levels were influenced by both male-female gonadal sex and XX-XY chromosome complement. Gonadectomy of adult mice revealed that the male-female differences are dependent on acute effects of gonadal hormones. In both intact and gonadectomized animals, XX mice had higher HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than XY mice, regardless of male-female sex. Feeding a cholesterol-enriched diet produced distinct patterns of sex differences in lipid levels compared with a chow diet, revealing the interaction of gonadal and chromosomal sex with diet. Notably, under all dietary and gonadal conditions, HDL-C levels were higher in mice with 2 X chromosomes compared with mice with an X and Y chromosome. By generating mice with XX, XY, and XXY chromosome complements, we determined that the presence of 2 X chromosomes, and not the absence of the Y chromosome, influences HDL-C concentration. Conclusions - We demonstrate that having 2 X chromosomes versus an X and Y chromosome complement drives sex differences in HDL-C.

It is imperative to understand the mechanisms underlying sex differences to devise optimal preventive and therapeutic approaches for all individuals. Both biological sex (determined by sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones) and gender (social and cultural behaviors associated with femininity or masculinity) influence differences between men and women in disease susceptibility and pathology. Here, we focus on the application of experimental mouse models that elucidate the influence of 2 components of biological sex - sex chromosome complement (XX or XY) and gonad type (ovaries or testes). These models have revealed that in addition to well-known effects of gonadal hormones, sex chromosome complement influences cardiovascular risk factors, such as plasma cholesterol levels and adiposity, as well as the development of atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension. One mechanism by which sex chromosome dosage influences cardiometabolic traits is through sex-biased expression of X chromosome genes that escape X inactivation. These include chromatin-modifying enzymes that regulate gene expression throughout the genome. The identification of factors that determine sex-biased gene expression and cardiometabolic traits will expand our mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular disease processes and provide insight into sex differences that remain throughout the lifespan as gonadal hormone levels alter with age.","L2018809851 2022-06-27","10.1161/circresaha.122.320259","animal experiment;animal model;animal tissue;article;atherosclerosis;cardiovascular disease;cardiovascular risk factor;cholesterol blood level;chromatin;controlled study;experimental mouse;female;gene expression;gonad;human;karyotype 46,XX;lifespan;male;mouse;nonhuman;obesity;ovary;pulmonary hypertension;sex chromosome;sex difference;testis;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;sex hormone;Cardiovascular Diseases;Sex Characteristics",NA,NA

Here we examined the meiotic chromatin landscape in germ lines of four Caenorhabditis species; C. remanei and C. brenneri represent ancestral gonochorism, while C. briggsae and C. elegans are two lineages that independently evolved hermaphroditism. While MSCI is conserved across all four species, repressive chromatin modifications are distinct and do not correlate with reproductive mode. In contrast to C. elegans and C. remanei germ cells where X chromosomes are enriched for histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation, X chromosomes in C. briggsae and C. brenneri germ cells are enriched for histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation. Inactivation of C. briggsae MET-2 resulted in germ-line X chromosome transcription and checkpoint activation. Further, both histone H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation were reduced in Cbr-met-2 mutant germ lines, suggesting that in contrast to C. elegans, H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation are interdependent.

Between 9 and 35 human/hamster hybrids that selectively retained the active human X chromosome were produced from the T cells of each woman and analyzed with an X-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism for which the woman in question was heterozygous.

We analyzed DNA methylation changes during reprogramming of male and female somatic cells and in resulting induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). At an intermediate reprogramming stage, somatic and pluripotency enhancers are targeted for partial methylation and demethylation. Demethylation within pluripotency enhancers often occurs at ESC binding sites of pluripotency transcription factors. Late in reprogramming, global hypomethylation is induced in a female-specific manner. Genome-wide hypomethylation in female cells affects many genomic landmarks, including enhancers and imprint control regions, and accompanies the reactivation of the inactive X chromosome. The loss of one of the two X chromosomes in propagating female iPSCs is associated with genome-wide methylation gain. Collectively, our findings highlight the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation at enhancers during reprogramming and reveal that X chromosome dosage dictates global DNA methylation levels in iPSCs. Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to iPSCs, inducing reactivation of the inactive X chromosome. Using genome-scale DNA methylation analyses, Plath, Pasque, and colleagues show that iPSCs adopt sex-specific differences in global DNA methylation that correlate with the presence of two active X chromosomes.

DNAm was used to predict an inactivation status for 63 novel transcription start sites (TSSs) across 27 tissues. There was high concordance of inactivation status across tissues, with 62% of TSSs subject to XCI in all 27 tissues examined, whereas 9% escaped from XCI in all tissues, and the remainder showed variable escape from XCI between females in subsets of tissues. Inter-female and twin data supported a model of predominately cis-acting influences on inactivation status. The level of expression from the inactive X relative to the active X correlated with the amount of female promoter DNAm to a threshold of ~30%, beyond which genes were consistently subject to inactivation. The inactive X showed lower DNAm than the active X at intragenic and intergenic regions for genes subject to XCI, but not at genes that escape from inactivation.

XIST is abnormally expressed in many sex-biased diseases. In addition, escape from XIST-mediated XCI and skewed XCI also contribute to sex-biased diseases. Therefore, its expression or modification can be regarded as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of many sex-biased diseases.

To equalize expression between X-linked and autosomal genes in the two sexes, male Drosophila hypertranscribe their single X, whereas female mammals silence one of their two X chromosomes. We combine fine-scale mapping data of dosage compensated regions with genome-wide expression profiles and show that most male-biased genes on the D. melanogaster X are located outside dosage compensated regions. Additionally, X-linked genes that have newly acquired male-biased expression in D. melanogaster are less likely to be dosage compensated, and parental X-linked genes that gave rise to an autosomal male-biased retrocopy are more likely located within compensated regions. This suggests that DC contributes to the observed demasculinization of X chromosomes in Drosophila, both by limiting the emergence of male-biased expression patterns of existing X genes, and by contributing to gene trafficking of male genes off the X.","1879-0445 Bachtrog, Doris Toda, Nicholas R T Lockton, Steven R01 GM076007/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States R01 GM076007-06/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States R01GM093182/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States R01GM076007/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2010/08/14 Curr Biol. 2010 Aug 24;20(16):1476-81. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2010.06.076.

Considerable number of studies also demonstrated that, after trauma and sepsis, females present better outcomes as compared to males indicating sex-related differences in the innate immune response. The current notion is that differences in the immuno-modulatory effects of sex hormones are the underlying causative mechanism. However, the field remains controversial and the exclusive role of sex hormones has been challenged. Here, we propose that polymorphic X-linked immune competent genes, which are abundant in the population are important players in sex-based immuno-modulation and play a key role in causing sex-related outcome differences following trauma or sepsis. We describe the differences in X chromosome (ChrX) regulation between males and females and its consequences in the context of common X-linked polymorphisms at the individual as well as population level. We also discuss the potential pathophysiological and immune-modulatory aspects of ChrX cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females and how this may contribute to sex-biased immune-modulation. The potential confounding effects of ChrX skewing of cell progenitors at the bone marrow is also presented together with aspects of acute trauma-induced de novo ChrX skewing at the periphery. In support of the hypothesis, novel observations indicating ChrX skewing in a female trauma cohort as well as case studies depicting the temporal relationship between trauma-induced cellular skewing and the clinical course are also described. Finally, we list and discuss a selected set of polymorphic X-linked genes, which are frequent in the population and have key regulatory or metabolic functions in the innate immune response and, therefore, are primary candidates for mediating sex-biased immune responses. We conclude that sex-related differences in a variety of disease processes including the innate inflammatory response to injury and infection may be related to the abundance of X-linked polymorphic immune-competent genes, differences in ChrX regulation, and inheritance patterns between the sexes and the presence of X-linked cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females.","1664-3224 Spolarics, Zoltan Peña, Geber Qin, Yong Donnelly, Robert J Livingston, David H R01 GM118602/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Switzerland 2017/11/29 Front Immunol. 2017 Nov 13;8:1455. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01455. eCollection 2017.","10.3389/fimmu.2017.01455","X chromosome inactivation;X chromosome skewing;cellular mosaicism;infection;injury;sepsis;sexual dimorphism;Tocopherols",NA,NA

Using genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), we focus on one TAD boundary on chromosome X harboring ~ 15 CTCF binding sites and located at the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) locus Firre. Specifically, this TAD boundary is invariant across evolution, tissues, and temporal dynamics of X-chromosome inactivation. We demonstrate that neither the deletion of this locus nor the ectopic insertion of Firre cDNA or its ectopic expression are sufficient to alter TADs in a sex-specific or allele-specific manner. In contrast, Firre's deletion disrupts the chromatin super-loop formation of the inactive X-chromosome.

Moreover, in hPGCs, both X chromosomes are active and express the long non-coding RNAs X active coating transcript (XACT) and X inactive specific transcript (XIST)—the master regulator of XCI—which are silenced after entry into meiosis. We find that XACT is a hPGC marker, describe XCD associated with XIST expression in hPGCs and suggest that XCD evolved in humans to regulate X-linked genes in pre-implantation embryos and PGCs.

Most females are mosaics, having a mixture of cells expressing either their mother's or father's X-linked genes.

Yet, in some cases the dynamic interactions between cells in mosaic females lead to female-specific disease manifestations. ©2006 American Medical Association.

Combined analysis of single embryo RNA-seq data and parental genome sequencing was used to evaluate parental contributions to early development and investigate X-chromosome dynamics. In addition, we evaluated dimorphism in gene expression between male and female embryos. Evaluation of parent-specific gene expression revealed a minor increase in paternal expression at the 4-cell stage that increased at the 8-cell stage. We also detected eight genes with allelic expression bias that may have an important role in early development, notably NANOGNB. The main actor in X-chromosome inactivation, XIST, was significantly upregulated at the 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages in female embryos, with high expression at the latter. Sexual dimorphism in gene expression was identified at all stages, with strong representation of the X-chromosome in females from the 16-cell to the blastocyst stage. Female embryos showed biparental X-chromosome expression at all stages after the 4-cell stage, demonstrating the absence of imprinted X-inactivation at the embryo level. The analysis of gene dosage showed incomplete dosage compensation (0.5 < X:A < 1) in MII oocytes and embryos up to the 4-cell stage, an increase of the X:A ratio at the 16-cell and morula stages after genome activation, and a decrease of the X:A ratio at the blastocyst stage, which might be associated with the beginning of X-chromosome inactivation.

As part of this question we asked whether mouse X-Y homologous gene pairs are expressed in brain in a sex-specific fashion. Using RT-PCR and northern blot analysis, we assessed mRNA expression in brain of eight Y-linked genes as well as their X-linked homologues, at three ages: 13.5 days post coitum, the day of birth (P1) and adult. Transcripts of six Y genes were expressed at one or more ages: Usp9y, Ube1y, Smcy, Eif2s3y, Uty and Dby. Their expression also occurred in XY female brain, and therefore does not require testicular secretions. Six X-linked homologues (Usp9x, Ube1x, Smcx, Eif2s3x, Utx and Dbx) were also expressed in brain, and in adulthood all of these transcripts were expressed at significantly higher levels in brains of females than in brains of males, irrespective of their X-inactivation status. For five of these gene pairs, the expression of the Y-linked homologue in males was not sufficient to compensate for the female bias in X gene expression. Three X-Y gene pairs, Usp9x/y, Ube1x/y and Eif2s3x/y, appeared to be differentially regulated (expressed in brain in a different age- or tissue-dependent pattern), and hence may not be functionally equivalent. These sex differences in X-Y gene expression suggest several mechanisms by which these genes may participate in sex differences in brain development and function.","L34746541 2002-07-22","","chromosome protein;messenger RNA;animal tissue;article;brain development;brain function;brain tissue;chromosome inactivation;controlled study;female;gene expression regulation;genetic transcription;male;mouse;nonhuman;Northern blotting;nucleotide sequence;priority journal;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;sex chromosome;sex difference;testis;X chromosome;Y chromosome;Sex Characteristics;Sex Chromosomes;Gene Expression;Brain",NA,NA

The temporal series of events that culminates in inactive X-specific gene silencing by DNA methylation has revealed a 'patchwork' of gene inactivation along the chromosome, with approximately 15% of genes escaping. Such genes are therefore potentially subject to sex-specific imbalance between males and females. Aside from XIST, the non-coding RNA on the X chromosome destined to be inactivated, very little is known about the extent of loci that may be selectively silenced on the active X chromosome (Xa). Using longitudinal array-based DNA methylation profiling of two human tissues, we have identified specific and widespread active X-specific DNA methylation showing stability over time and across tissues of disparate origin. Our panel of X-chromosome loci subject to methylation on Xa reflects a potentially novel mechanism for controlling female-specific X inactivation and sex-specific dimorphisms in humans.

Immunofluorescence studies showed that soon after Xist RNA coating the inactive X (Xi) undergoes many heterochromatic changes, including the acquisition of H3K27me3. However, the mechanisms that lead to the establishment of heterochromatin remain unclear. We first analyze chromatin changes by ChIP-chip, as well as RNA expression, around the X-inactivation center (Xic) in female and male ES cells, and their day 4 and 10 differentiated derivatives. A dynamic epigenetic landscape is observed within the Xic locus. Tsix repression is accompanied by deposition of H3K27me3 at its promoter during differentiation of both female and male cells. However, only in female cells does an active epigenetic landscape emerge at the Xist locus, concomitant with high Xist expression. Several regions within and around the Xic show unsuspected chromatin changes, and we define a series of unusual loci containing highly enriched H3K27me3. Genomewide ChIP-seq analyses show a female-specific quantitative increase of H3K27me3 across the X chromosome as XCI proceeds in differentiating female ES cells. Using female ES cells with nonrandom XCI and polymorphic X chromosomes, we demonstrate that this increase is specific to the Xi by allele-specific SNP mapping of the ChIP-seq tags. H3K27me3 becomes evenly associated with the Xi in a chromosome-wide fashion. A selective and robust increase of H3K27me3 and concomitant decrease in H3K4me3 is observed over active genes. This indicates that deposition of H3K27me3 during XCI is tightly associated with the act of silencing of individual genes across the Xi. © 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.","L355049283 2009-09-21","10.1101/gr.092643.109","DNA;histone H3;lysine;RNA;allele;animal cell;article;cell culture;cell differentiation;chromatin immunoprecipitation;embryonic stem cell;epigenetics;female;fluorescence in situ hybridization;gene;gene assignment;gene expression;gene repression;gene silencing;heterochromatin;immunofluorescence;male;microarray analysis;mouse;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;priority journal;promoter region;protein expression;quantitative analysis;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;sex difference;tsix gene;X chromosome inactivation;xist gene",NA,NA

Here, we used an in vitro differentiation model to convert human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into trophoblastic progenitor cells of the first-trimester placenta, which will eventually become mature extravillous trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. We observed significant sex differences in transcriptomic profiles of hESCs and trophoblastic progenitors, and also with the differentiation process itself. Male cells had higher dosage of X/Y gene pairs relative to female samples, supporting functions for Y-linked genes beyond spermatogenesis in the hESCs and in the early placenta. Female-specific differentiation altered the expression of several thousand genes compared with male cells, and female cells specifically upregulated numerous autosomal genes with known roles in trophoblast function. Sex-biased upregulation of cellular pathways during trophoblast differentiation was also evident. This study is the first to identify sex differences in trophoblastic progenitor cells of the first-trimester human placenta, and reveal early origins for sexual dimorphism.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 9 Total Times Cited: 9 Cited Reference Count: 69","10.1089/scd.2018.0081","sex differences;sex-biased gene expression;in vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem cells;XIST RNA;human trophoblastic progenitor cells;human placental development;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;DOSAGE COMPENSATION;Y-CHROMOSOMES;TROPHOBLAST;DISEASE;REQUIREMENT;METHYLATION;DERIVATION;EVOLUTION;PATTERNS;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Stem Cells",NA,NA

We previously studied two female patients with HSD10 deficiency, one of them was severely affected and the other presented a mild phenotype. To elucidate as to why these two carriers were so differently affected, cDNA analyses were performed. The HSD17B10 cDNA of eight control cell lines, two hemizygous patients and two carriers was obtained from cultured fibroblasts, amplified by PCR and sequenced by standard methods. All HSD17B10 cDNAs were quantified by real-time PCR. In the fibroblasts of the female patient who presented with the severe phenotype, only the mutant allele was identified in the cDNA sequence, which was further confirmed by relative quantification (RQ) of HSD17B10 cDNA. This is in agreement with an unfavourable X-inactivation. The other female patient, with slight clinical affectation, showed the presence of both mutant and wild-type alleles in the cDNA sequence, which was confirmed by RQ of HSD17B10 cDNA in fibroblasts. This is in line with normal X-inactivation and the expression of both alleles in different cells (functional mosaicism). RQ results of HSD17B10 cDNA did not differ significantly between male and female controls, which indicate that the genetic doses of mRNA of HSD17B10 was the same in both sexes.

We found that mESCs grown in a ground state 2i condition displayed transcriptomic profiles diffused from preimplantation mouse embryonic cells, whereas EpiStem cells closely resembled the post-implantation epiblast. Sex-related gene expression varied greatly across distinct developmental states. We also identified novel markers that were highly enriched in each developmental state.

The cases were also distinguished by presence or absence of additional congenital anomalies. 20% of the primary neurulation defects had additional congenital anomalies, while there was no increase in congenital anomalies among the canalisation defect group. The M/F sex ratio for all isolated NTDs (ie, without additional anomalies), including both neurulation and canalisation defects, was 0.83, while that of all NTDs with additional anomalies was 1.2. The sex ratio for isolated cases of all primary neurulation defects was 0.65. The sex ratio for all other categories of NTDs (except the very small group of multiple neural tube defects with anomalies) was greater than or close to 1.0 or had been skewed away from 1.0 by having isolated primary NTDs within the category. Thus our data resemble those of Martinez Frias et al. We did not find the excess of females only in the group of NTDs with abnormal thoracic and cervical vertebrae which Seller observed in her pathological specimens; in our clinic population there was an excess of females among isolated primary neurulation defects of all types. This difference may be related to the fact that most of our cases were term deliveries or liveborn rather than terminations. Seller and James have suggested that female embryos develop more slowly than males, making them susceptible to failure of proper neural tube formation. We would like to suggest that some component of the slower early embryological development seen in females may be secondary to delayed X inactivation, of some or all of an X chromosome in some or all of the cells of the female embryos with NTDs. Late inactivation would make those cells in the developing embryo aneuploid with regard to the X chromosome by virtue of having two active X chromosomes. A variety of human aneuploidies predispose to NTDs. Aneuploid cells would be expected to divide more slowly than normal (eg, more slowly than male cells or female cells which have completed normal inactivation of one X). A slower rate of cell division and tissue growth would be expected to predispose to failure of neural tube closure (primary neurulation). This hypothesis should be testable in mice with appropriate X chromosome markers to demonstrate X inactivation or lack thereof in early embryo development.","L17177886 1987-01-21","","central nervous system;clinical article;congenital disorder;etiology;heredity;human;neural tube defect;priority journal;sex;sex difference;sex ratio;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Neural Tube Defects;Sex Ratio",NA,NA

Xist, a gene mapping to the X-inactivation centre (Xic), is exclusively expressed from the inactive X-chromosome and is thought to be involved in the initiation of X-inactivation. Consistent with this, Xist is first expressed at the 4-to 8-cell stages, prior to functional inactivation at the blastocyst stage, exclusively from X(P) in female embryos. This also suggests that genomic imprinting may influence the earliest expression of Xist resulting in selective inactivation of X(P) and a candidate methylation site in the promoter region has recently been described. Here we report the expression of the human homologue, XIST, in human preimplantation embryos from the 5- to 10-cell stage onwards consistent with its role in the initiation of inactivation.
