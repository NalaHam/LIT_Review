D.","Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) is a dominantly inherited heterogeneous genetic disorder with multisystem abnormalities. Sixty percent of probands with CdLS have heterozygous mutations in the Nipped-B-like (NIPBL) gene, 5% have mutations in the SMC1A gene, and one proband was found to have a mutation in the SMC3 gene. Cohesin is a multisubunit complex consisting of a SMC1A and SMC3 heterodimer and two non-SMC subunits. SMC1A is located on the human X chromosome and is reported to escape X inactivation. Twenty-nine unrelated CdLS probands with 21 unique SMC1A mutations have been identified including seven males. All mutations identified to date are either missense or small deletions, with all presumably preserving the protein open reading frame. Both wild-type and mutant alleles are expressed. Females quantitatively express twice the amount of SMC1A mRNA compared to males. The transcriptional profiling of 23 selected genes is different in SMC1A mutant probands, controls, and NIPBL mutant probands. These results suggest that mechanistically SMC1A-related CdLS is not due to altered levels of the SMC1A transcript, but rather that the mutant proteins maintain a residual function in males and enact a dominant negative effect in females. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","experiment","Nipped-B-like (NIPBL), SMC1A, SMC3","","","","EXCI","cornelia de lange syndrome (cdls)","","","","","","relevant"

Mutations in the MECP2 gene were identified in approximately 70-80% of sporadic Rett syndrome cases. Methods - We have screened the MECP2 gene coding region for mutations in five familial cases of Rett syndrome and studied the patterns of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in each girl. Results - We found a mutation in MECP2 in only one family. In the four families without mutation in MECP2, we found that (1) all mothers exhibit a totally skewed pattern of XCI; (2) six out of eight affected girls also have a totally skewed pattern of XCI; and (3) it is the paternally inherited X chromosome which is active in the patients with a skewed pattern of XCI. Given that the skewing of XCI is inherited in our families, we genotyped the whole X chromosome using 32 polymorphic markers and we show that a locus potentially responsible for the skewed XCI in these families could be located on the short arm of the X chromosome. Conclusion - These data led us to propose a model for familial Rett syndrome transmission in which two traits are inherited, an X linked locus abnormally escaping X chromosome inactivation and the presence of a skewed XCI in carrier women.","experiment","MECP2","x","","","skewed XCI, EXCI","rett syndrome, neurological","","pedigree","","","","relevant"

L.","There is currently no effective treatment for Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe X-linked progressive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the transcriptional regulator MECP2. Because MECP2 is subjected to X-inactivation, most affected individuals are female heterozygotes who display cellular mosaicism for normal and mutant MECP2. Males who are hemizygous for mutant MECP2 are more severely affected than heterozygous females and rarely survive. Mecp2 loss-of-function is less severe in mice, however, and male hemizygous null mice not only survive until adulthood, they have been the most commonly studied model system. Although heterozygous female mice better recapitulate human RTT, they have not been as thoroughly characterized. This is likely because of the added experimental challenges that they present, including delayed and more variable phenotypic progression and cellular mosaicism due to X-inactivation. In this review, we compare phenotypes of Mecp2 heterozygous female mice and male hemizygous null mouse models. Further, we discuss the complexities that arise from the many cell-type and tissue-type specific roles of MeCP2, as well as the combination of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous disruptions that result from Mecp2 loss-of-function. This is of particular importance in the context of the female heterozygous brain, composed of a mixture of MeCP2+ and MeCP2- cells, the ratio of which can alter RTT phenotypes in the case of skewed X-inactivation. The goal of this review is to provide a clearer understanding of the pathophysiological differences between the mouse models, which is an essential consideration in the design of future pre-clinical studies.","review","MECP2","","","","MeCP2 functions","rett syndrome","","mice","","x","","The goal of this review is to provide a clearer understanding of the pathophysiological differences between the mouse models"

We have previously reported that complete deficiency (CD) and partial deficiency (PD) in Japanese subjects resulted from two distinct mutations of the TBG gene, TBG-CDJ and TBG-PDJ, respectively. Recently, we encountered a female manifesting TBG-CD and herein investigated the molecular mechanisms. She was found to possess TBG-CDJ and common-type TBG (TBG-C) alleles by characterizing the TBG gene. Then, X-chromosome inactivation status was evaluated in her family members using a phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene, located on Xq13. Three TBG-CDJ heterozygotes and one unaffected female, confirmed to be PGK heterozygotes for a polymorphic BstXI site, were analyzed. Only the CD female was shown to undergo selective inactivation by examining the BstXI site in amplified products after digestion with a methylation sensitive enzyme, HpaII. Among an additional eight informative females with TBG deficiency, one heterozygous female for TBG-PDJ shared this selective inactivation pattern. Moreover, the X-chromosome with TBG-C was suggested to be inactivated selectively from the linkage of PGK and TBG alleles recognized in eight of nine family members. Selective X-chromosome inactivation was considered to be the cause of a female heterozygous for TBG- CDJ or -PDJ manifesting the same phenotype as a hemizygote.","experiment","T4-binding globulin (TBG)","","","","XCI","thyroxine-binding globulin (tbg) deficiency","","","","","","Selective X-chromosome inactivation was considered to be the cause of a female heterozygous for TBG- CDJ or -PDJ manifesting the same phenotype as a hemizygote."

Although genes that cause AS are well characterized, people with AS who have similar genetic mutations present with a wide variation in the extent of kidney impairment and age of onset, suggesting the activities of modifier genes. METHODS: We created a cohort of genetically diverse XLAS male and female mice using the Diversity Outbred mouse resource and measured albuminuria, GFR, and gene expression. Using a quantitative trait locus approach, we mapped modifier genes that can best explain the underlying phenotypic variation measured in our diverse population. RESULTS: Genetic analysis identified several loci associated with the variation in albuminuria and GFR, including a locus on the X chromosome associated with X inactivation and a locus on chromosome 2 containing Fmn1. Subsequent analysis of genetically reduced Fmn1 expression in Col4a5 knockout mice showed a decrease in albuminuria, podocyte effacement, and podocyte protrusions in the glomerular basement membrane, which support the candidacy of Fmn1 as a modifier gene for AS. CONCLUSION: With this novel approach, we emulated the variability in the severity of kidney phenotypes found in human patients with Alport Syndrome through albuminuria and GFR measurements. This approach can identify modifier genes in kidney disease that can be used as novel therapeutic targets.","experiment","COL4A5, Fmn1","","","","albuminuria production","x-linked alport syndrome (xlas), kidney","","mice","","x","",""

Objective: To describe the phenotypes and molecular data of 8 symptomatic female patients with XDP from 5 kindreds. Methods: Case series. Results: The average age of onset of symptoms was 52 years (range, 26-75 years). Six of 8 patients had parkinsonism, whereas only 1 had dystonia. The initial symptom was focal tremor or parkinsonism in 4, chorea in 3, and focal dystonia (cervical) in 1. Seven of 8 patients had slow or no progression of their symptoms and required no treatment. The patient with disabling parkinsonism was responsive to carbidopa/levodopa. Seven were heterozygous for the XDP haplotype, whereas 1 was homozygous. Conclusions: The phenotypes of female patients with XDP may include parkinsonism, dystonia, myoclonus, tremor, and chorea. The dystonia, if present, is mild and usually nonprogressive. Similar to men with XDP, parkinsonism is a frequent symptom in women. In contrast to men, affected women have a more benign phenotype, older age of onset, and milder course.

We previously studied two female patients with HSD10 deficiency, one of them was severely affected and the other presented a mild phenotype. To elucidate as to why these two carriers were so differently affected, cDNA analyses were performed. The HSD17B10 cDNA of eight control cell lines, two hemizygous patients and two carriers was obtained from cultured fibroblasts, amplified by PCR and sequenced by standard methods. All HSD17B10 cDNAs were quantified by real-time PCR. In the fibroblasts of the female patient who presented with the severe phenotype, only the mutant allele was identified in the cDNA sequence, which was further confirmed by relative quantification (RQ) of HSD17B10 cDNA. This is in agreement with an unfavourable X-inactivation. The other female patient, with slight clinical affectation, showed the presence of both mutant and wild-type alleles in the cDNA sequence, which was confirmed by RQ of HSD17B10 cDNA in fibroblasts. This is in line with normal X-inactivation and the expression of both alleles in different cells (functional mosaicism). RQ results of HSD17B10 cDNA did not differ significantly between male and female controls, which indicate that the genetic doses of mRNA of HSD17B10 was the same in both sexes.

H.","The CHILD syndrome (MIM 308050), an acronym for congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects, is an X-linked dominant trait with lethality for male embryos. Recently, we elucidated the underlying gene defect by demonstrating point mutations in NSDHL (NAD[P]H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein) at Xq28 in 6 patients with classic CHILD syndrome. The most striking clinical feature is an inflammatory nevus that usually shows a unique lateralization with strict midline demarcation. Ipsilateral defects involve all skeletal structures and internal organs such as the brain, the lung, the heart, or the kidney. As an exception to this rule, in some cases the CHILD nevus may occur in a more or less bilateral distribution. In 1997 Fink-Puches et al described a case of CHILD nevus with an almost symmetric arrangement. To test the correctness of the diagnosis, we now examined blood lymphocytes of this patient by single-strand conformation analysis and genomic sequencing. We identified a novel missense mutation in NSDHL that potentially may impair protein function. We conclude that a diagnosis of CHILD syndrome can be based on clinical features such as the highly characteristic morphology of the CHILD nevus. A symmetric distribution of this nevus can exceptionally be seen in patients with CHILD syndrome, and this bilateral involvement should not mislead the clinician to any other diagnosis. Apparently, the effect of random X-inactivation is responsible for different patterns of cutaneous involvement in female carriers of NSDHL mutations.","experiment","NSDHL","","","","mosaicism","congenital hemidysplasia","","","","x","",""

Recent observations have highlighted a critical role of XIAP for the regulation of NOD2 signaling and are probably the molecular basis for increasingly recognized further immune dysregulatory symptoms of XIAP deficient patients, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We describe a large Caucasian family in which IBD and erythema nodosum (EN) also manifested in female carriers of XIAP mutations. METHODS: Clinical data and laboratory findings including flow cytometric analysis of XIAP protein expression and sequencing of the BIRC4 gene. NOD2 signaling was investigated by determination of TNFŒ± production in monocytes upon L18-MDP stimulation in vitro. RESULTS: The BIRC4 nonsense mutation p.P225SfsX226 was identified as the genetic cause of XIAP deficiency in our family. Surprisingly, clinical symptoms were not restricted to male patients, but also occurred in several female carriers. The most severely affected carrier demonstrated random X-inactivation, leading to a significant expression of mutated XIAP protein in monocytes, and consequently to impaired NOD2 responses in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our report provides further evidence that clinical symptoms of XIAP deficiency are not restricted to male patients. Random X-inactivation may be associated with EN and mild IBD also in female carriers of BIRC4 mutations. Analysis of the X-inactivation pattern reflected by XIAP protein expression can identify such carriers and the analysis of NOD2 signaling by flow cytometry can confirm the functional significance. XIAP expression patterns should be investigated in female patients with a family history of EN and/or IBD.","experiment","BIRC4","","","","random XCI","x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (xiap) deficiency, erythema nodosum,  inflammatory bowel disease","","","Caucasian","x","",""
