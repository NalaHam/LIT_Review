K. and Gyrd-Hansen, M. and Salzer, U. and Speckmann, C. and Grimbacher, B.","PURPOSE: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency caused by mutations in BIRC4 was originally described in male patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 2 (XLP2). Recent observations have highlighted a critical role of XIAP for the regulation of NOD2 signaling and are probably the molecular basis for increasingly recognized further immune dysregulatory symptoms of XIAP deficient patients, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We describe a large Caucasian family in which IBD and erythema nodosum (EN) also manifested in female carriers of XIAP mutations. METHODS: Clinical data and laboratory findings including flow cytometric analysis of XIAP protein expression and sequencing of the BIRC4 gene. NOD2 signaling was investigated by determination of TNFŒ± production in monocytes upon L18-MDP stimulation in vitro. RESULTS: The BIRC4 nonsense mutation p.P225SfsX226 was identified as the genetic cause of XIAP deficiency in our family. Surprisingly, clinical symptoms were not restricted to male patients, but also occurred in several female carriers. The most severely affected carrier demonstrated random X-inactivation, leading to a significant expression of mutated XIAP protein in monocytes, and consequently to impaired NOD2 responses in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our report provides further evidence that clinical symptoms of XIAP deficiency are not restricted to male patients. Random X-inactivation may be associated with EN and mild IBD also in female carriers of BIRC4 mutations. Analysis of the X-inactivation pattern reflected by XIAP protein expression can identify such carriers and the analysis of NOD2 signaling by flow cytometry can confirm the functional significance. XIAP expression patterns should be investigated in female patients with a family history of EN and/or IBD.","experiment","BIRC4","","","","random XCI","x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (xiap) deficiency, erythema nodosum,  inflammatory bowel disease","","","Caucasian","x","",""

The mechanisms underlying these sex differences probably involve both hormonal and genetic factors. In order to evaluate a possible genetic influence, we reviewed clinical signs and biological inflammatory markers of prepubertal children with severe sepsis admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Findings: A total of 142 prepubertal children, 66 girls and 76 boys, suffering from severe sepsis and admitted to the PICU were included. The survival rate demonstrated a tendency to be higher in females (P = 0.14). Maximum white blood cell count (23,800 cells/mu L [15,110-34,600] in girls vs. 19,025 cells/mu L [12,358-26,098] in boys, P = 0.02), neutrophil count (16,944 cells/mu L [10,620-27,540] vs. 13,756 cells/mu L [8410-20,110], P = 0.03), and C-reactive protein level (26.2 mg/dL [15.7-33.6] vs. 18.8 mg/dL [11.1-30.0], P = 0.04) were all significantly higher in girls. Girls also exhibited significantly longer fever duration (2 days [1-6] vs. 1 day [1-3] for the boys, P<0.01), lower pH on admission (7.32 [7.25-7.39] vs. 7.37 [7.31-7.43] P = 0.03), and lower base excess (-6 mEq/L [-10.7 to -0.8] vs. -2.3 mEq/L [-6.6 to -2.6], P<0.01), as well as lower bicarbonate levels (19.1 mEq/l [15.9-24.0] vs. 21.15 mEq/l [18.3-26.68], P = 0.04), when compared with the boys. Conclusions: Our study revealed higher neutrophilic inflammation, as well as lower pH on admission, in girls with severe sepsis; associated with longer fever duration, which could contribute to better pathogen clearance. However, further studies are needed to demonstrate the link between acidosis and modulation of the immune response.","experiment","","","","","PH levels","inflammation, sepsis","","","","x","",""
