"1",168,"Illuminating the Mechanisms Underlying Sex Differences in Cardiovascular Disease",2022,"Circulation Research","Reue, K. and Wiese, C. B.","Sex is a key risk factor for many types of cardiovascular disease. It is imperative to understand the mechanisms underlying sex differences to devise optimal preventive and therapeutic approaches for all individuals. Both biological sex (determined by sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones) and gender (social and cultural behaviors associated with femininity or masculinity) influence differences between men and women in disease susceptibility and pathology. Here, we focus on the application of experimental mouse models that elucidate the influence of 2 components of biological sex - sex chromosome complement (XX or XY) and gonad type (ovaries or testes). These models have revealed that in addition to well-known effects of gonadal hormones, sex chromosome complement influences cardiovascular risk factors, such as plasma cholesterol levels and adiposity, as well as the development of atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension. One mechanism by which sex chromosome dosage influences cardiometabolic traits is through sex-biased expression of X chromosome genes that escape X inactivation. These include chromatin-modifying enzymes that regulate gene expression throughout the genome. The identification of factors that determine sex-biased gene expression and cardiometabolic traits will expand our mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular disease processes and provide insight into sex differences that remain throughout the lifespan as gonadal hormone levels alter with age.`","experiment","","chromatin-modifying enzymes","","x","EXCI","cardiovascular, cardiac, adiposity, atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension","x","","","","","very relevant"
"2",61,"Gender and the regulation of longevity: Implications for autoimmunity",2012,"Autoimmunity Reviews","Pan, Z. and Chang, C.","For humans and other animals, gender has an influence not only on their physical attributes, but also on life span. In humans, females have a longer life span than males. The reasons for this are not entirely clear. The role of gender in the regulation of longevity may be linked to gender specific genetic differences, including the expression of sex hormone patterns and the changes in these patterns during an individual's lifetime. In addition, the effect of sex hormones on other physiologic responses to environmental influences on cellular stress and oxidative damage may play a role in longevity. Gender can impact many disease states, including autoimmune diseases, and the factors that affect the development of autoimmune diseases and the regulation of longevity may share common mechanistic pathways. Other factors that may play a role include telomere and telomerase related differences, caloric restriction and changes in mitochondrial DNA. Inflammatory and regulatory pathways such as insulin/IGF signaling and Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling may also play a role in longevity and aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer's. The role of gender differences in the regulation of these pathways or factors is not entirely clear. The role of X-chromosome inactivation in longevity has also yet to be fully elucidated. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","review?","","","","","","autoimmune, longevity","","","","x","","seems very broad to include"

Using a mouse model that segregates gonadal sex (ovaries and testes) from chromosomal sex (XX and XY), we showed that XX chromosome complement in combination with a high-fat diet led to enhanced weight gain in the presence of male or female gonads. We identified the genomic dosage of Kdm5c, an X chromosome gene that escapes X chromosome inactivation, as a determinant of the X chromosome effect on adiposity. Modulating Kdm5c gene dosage in XX female mice to levels that are normally present in males resulted in reduced body weight, fat content, and food intake to a degree similar to that seen with altering the entire X chromosome dosage. In cultured preadipocytes, the levels of KDM5C histone demethylase influenced chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq), gene expression (RNA-Seq), and adipocyte differentiation. Both in vitro and in vivo, Kdm5c dosage influenced gene expression involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, which is critical for adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue expansion. In humans, adipose tissue KDM5C mRNA levels and KDM5C genetic variants were associated with body mass. These studies demonstrate that the sex-dependent dosage of Kdm5c contributes to male/female differences in adipocyte biology and highlight X-escape genes as a critical component of female physiology.","experiment","KDM5C","","","x","cellular","adiposity","histone demethylase","mRNA, gene variants","","","",""

J. and Gomez, J. L. and Nino, G.","Human respiratory conditions are largely influenced by the individual's sex resulting in overall higher risk for males. Sex-based respiratory differences are present at birth suggesting a strong genetic component. Our objective was to characterize early life sex-based genomic signatures determined by variable X-chromosome methylation in the airways. We compared male versus female genome-wide DNA methylation in nasal airway samples from newborns and infants aged 1-6 months (N = 12). We analyzed methylation signals across CpG sites mapped to each X-linked gene using an unsupervised classifier (principal components) followed by an internal evaluation and an exhaustive cross-validation. Results were validated in an independent population of children (N = 72) following the same algorithm. X-linked genes with significant sex-based differential methylation in the nasal airway of infants represented only about 50% of the unique protein coding transcripts. X-linked genes without significant sex-based differential methylation included genes with evidence of escaping X-inactivation and female-biased airway expression. These genes showed similar methylation patterns in males and females suggesting unbalanced X-chromosome dosage. In conclusion, we identified that the human airways have already sex-based DNA methylation signatures at birth. These early airway epigenomic marks may determine sex-based respiratory phenotypes and overall predisposition to develop respiratory disorders later in life.","experiment","","","","x","","respiratory","CpG, DNA methylation","DNA methylation","","","","might have more specific genes in actual paper"

A. and Müller, I. and Mählich, D. and Veltman, C. and Niehoff, A. and Wirth, B.","For a long time, PLS3 (plastin 3, also known as T-plastin or fimbrin) has been considered a rather inconspicuous protein, involved in F-actin-binding and -bundling. However, in recent years, a plethora of discoveries have turned PLS3 into a highly interesting protein involved in many cellular processes, signaling pathways, and diseases. PLS3 is localized on the X-chromosome, but shows sex-specific, inter-individual and tissue-specific expression variability pointing towards skewed X-inactivation. PLS3 is expressed in all solid tissues but usually not in hematopoietic cells. When escaping X-inactivation, PLS3 triggers a plethora of different types of cancers. Elevated PLS3 levels are considered a prognostic biomarker for cancer and refractory response to therapies. When it is knocked out or mutated in humans and mice, it causes osteoporosis with bone fractures; it is the only protein involved in actin dynamics responsible for osteoporosis. Instead, when PLS3 is upregulated, it acts as a highly protective SMN-independent modifier in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Here, it seems to counteract reduced F-actin levels by restoring impaired endocytosis and disturbed calcium homeostasis caused by reduced SMN levels. In contrast, an upregulation of PLS3 on wild-type level might cause osteoarthritis. This emphasizes that the amount of PLS3 in our cells must be precisely balanced; both too much and too little can be detrimental. Actin-dynamics, regulated by PLS3 among others, are crucial in a lot of cellular processes including endocytosis, cell migration, axonal growth, neurotransmission, translation, and others. Also, PLS3 levels influence the infection with different bacteria, mycosis, and other pathogens.","experiment","PLS3","","","x","cell development","cancer, osteoporosis","","","","","","When escaping X-inactivation, PLS3 triggers a plethora of different types of cancers."

Whether this X-linked condition could be detected in the adult or also could affect women is unknown. A large five-generation family was identified in which the recently described arginine-vasopressin receptor type 2 (AVPR2) mutation that is responsible for NSIAD was segregated. The proband was a 74-yr-old patient who had a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and whose hyponatremia resisted administration of two AVPR2 antagonists. The phenotype of family members who carry the mutation was investigated. Patients with normal serum sodium were subjected to a water-load test. The previously reported activating missense R137C mutation in the AVPR2 gene in three hemizygous male and four heterozygous female individuals was identified. Except in one woman, spontaneous episodes of hyponatremia or abnormal water-load test were identified in all patients with the mutation, whether male or female. Skewed X inactivation was evidenced in the blood of the asymptomatic woman, which is compatible with preferential inactivation of her mutated allele. NSIAD is not limited to male infants. The diagnosis also should be considered in both male and female adults.

L. and Clayton-Smith, J.","DDX3X (Xp11.4) encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase that escapes X chromosome inactivation. Pathogenic variants in DDX3X have been shown to cause X-linked intellectual disability (ID) (MRX102, MIM: 300958). The phenotypes associated with DDX3X variants are heterogeneous and include brain and behavioral abnormalities, microcephaly, hypotonia, and movement disorders and/or spasticity. The majority of DDX3X variants described are de novo mutations in females with ID. In contrast, most male DDX3X variants are inherited from an unaffected mother, with one documented exception being a recently identified de novo splice site variant. It has been suggested, therefore, that DDX3X exerts its effects through haploinsufficiency in females, and that affected males carry hypomorphic alleles that retain partial function. Given the lack of male de novo DDX3X variants, loss-of-function variants in this gene are suspected to be male lethal. Through whole-exome sequencing, we identified three unrelated males with hemizygous missense DDX3X variants and ID. All three variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, with two established as de novo. In silico analyses were supportive of pathogenicity. We report the male phenotypes and compare them to phenotypes observed in previously reported male and female patients. In conclusion, we propose that de novo DDX3X variants are not necessarily male lethal and should be considered as a cause of syndromic ID in both males and females.","experiment","DDX3X","","","","","intellectual disability, behavioral, neurological, microcephaly, hypotonia","","Sanger sequencing","","x","",""

The aim of present study was to perform an X chromosome-wide association study (X-WAS) for asthma symptoms. The study included 1307 children of which 294 were asthma cases. DNA was genotyped using 2.5 HumanOmni Beadchip from Illumina. Statistical analyses were performed in PLINK 1.9, MACH 1.0 and Minimac2. The variant rs12007907 (g.29483892C>A) in IL1RAPL gene was suggestively associated with asthma symptoms in discovery set (odds ratio (OR)=0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37-0.67; P=3.33 √ó 10 - 6). This result was replicated in the ProAr cohort in men only (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.21-0.95; P=0.038). Furthermore, investigating the functional role of the rs12007907 on the production a Th2-type cytokine, IL-13, we found a negative association between the minor allele A with IL-13 production in the discovery set (P=0.044). Gene-based analysis revealed that NUDT10 was the most consistently associated with asthma symptoms in discovery sample. In conclusion, the rs12007907 variant in IL1RAPL gene was negatively associated with asthma and IL-13 production in our study and a sex-specific association was observed in one of the validation samples. It suggests an effect on asthma susceptibility and may explain differences in severe asthma frequency between women and men.","experiment","IL1RAPL","x","","","","asthma","","X chromosome-wide association study (X-WAS)","Latin American children","","","maybe be relevant"
"11",391,"Sex-related differences in chromatic sensitivity",2008,"Visual Neuroscience","Rodr√≠guez-Carmona, M. and Sharpe, L. T. and Harlow, J. A. and Barbur, J. L.","Generally women are believed to be more discriminating than men in the use of color names and this is often taken to imply superior color vision. However, if both X-chromosome linked color deficient males (‚àº8%) and females (<1%) as well as heterozygote female carriers (‚àº15%) are excluded from comparisons, then differences between men and women in red-green (RG) color discrimination have been reported as not being significant (e.g., Pickford, 1944; Hood et al., 2006). We re-examined this question by assessing the performance of 150 males and 150 females on the color assessment and diagnosis (CAD) test (Rodriguez-Carmona et al., 2005). This is a sensitive test that yields small color detection thresholds. The test employs direction-specific, moving, chromatic stimuli embedded in a background of random, dynamic, luminance contrast noise. A four-alternative, forced-choice procedure is employed to measure the subject's thresholds for detection of color signals in 16 directions in color space, while ensuring that the subject cannot make use of any residual luminance contrast signals. In addition, we measured the Rayleigh anomaloscope matches in a subgroup of 111 males and 114 females. All the age-matched males (30.8 ¬± 9.7) and females (26.7 ¬± 8.8) had normal color vision as diagnosed by a battery of conventional color vision tests. Females with known color deficient relatives were excluded from the study. Comparisons between the male and female groups revealed no significant differences in anomaloscope midpoints (p = 0.709), but a significant difference in matching ranges (p = 0.040); females on average tended to have a larger mean range (4.11) than males (3.75). Females also had significantly higher CAD thresholds than males along the RG (p = 0.0004), but not along the yellow-blue (YB) discrimination axis. The differences between males and females in RG discrimination may be related to the heterozygosity in X-linked cone photo pigment expression common among females.
