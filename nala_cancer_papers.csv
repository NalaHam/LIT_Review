H.","It has long been known that males are more susceptible than females to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the reason remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of the long noncoding RNA FTX (lnc-FTX), an X-inactive-specific transcript (XIST) regulator transcribed from the X chromosome inactivation center, in both HCC and HCC gender disparity. lnc-FTX is expressed at higher levels in female livers than in male livers and is significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues. Patients with higher lnc-FTX expression exhibited longer survival, suggesting that lnc-FTX is a useful prognostic factor for HCC patients. lnc-FTX inhibits HCC cell growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, lnc-FTX represses Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity by competitively sponging miR-374a and inhibits HCC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion. In addition, lnc-FTX binds to the DNA replication licensing factor MCM2, thereby impeding DNA replication and inhibiting proliferation in HCC cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that lnc-FTX may act as a tumor suppressor in HCC through physically binding miR-374a and MCM2. It may also be one of the reasons for HCC gender disparity and may potentially contribute to HCC treatment.","experiment","lnc-FTX, Xist","miR-374a, MCM2","","","","hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), cancer","","","","","","very relevant"

It represents an acquired form of alpha-thalassaemia that most commonly arises in the context of myelodysplasia. It has recently been shown that this condition occurs in association with somatic mutations of a known X-encoded trans-acting regulator of alpha globin gene (HBA) expression, ATRX. There is an unexplained, strong male preponderance of individuals with the ATMDS phenotype with a >5:1 male-female ratio and furthermore, all the somatic ATRX mutations described to date have been in males. Here we report the identification, in a single centre, of two females with ATMDS and mutations in the ATRX gene, proving that ATMDS associated with such mutations may occur, albeit rarely, in females. It seemed possible that females might be less likely to develop ATMDS if the inactivated copy of the ATRX gene (ATRX) became progressively re-activated throughout life. This study ruled out this hypothesis by investigating the pattern of ATRX inactivation in a cross-sectional analysis of normal females at ages ranging from newborn to 90 years.","experiment","ATRX","x","","","EXCI","alpha thalassaemia myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloid malignancy, ","case study","","","","","very relevant"

The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) is involved in X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female placental mammals, a process that ensures the balanced expression dosage of X-linked genes between sexes. XIST is abnormally expressed in many sex-biased diseases. In addition, escape from XIST-mediated XCI and skewed XCI also contribute to sex-biased diseases. Therefore, its expression or modification can be regarded as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of many sex-biased diseases. Genetic manipulation of XIST expression can inhibit the progression of some of these diseases in animal models, and therefore XIST has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target. In this manuscript, we summarize the current knowledge about the mechanisms for XIST-mediated XCI and the roles of XIST in sex-biased diseases, and discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting XIST.","review","Xist","","","","XCI, Xist regulation","autoimmune, neurological, pulmonary hypertension, cancer","","","","","","very relevant, exactly what we want to write"

On the whole, gender differences appear to be pervasive and still poorly considered and investigated despite their biomedical relevance. The basic biological mechanisms responsible for gender differences in aging and longevity are quite complex and still poorly understood. The present review focuses on centenarians and their offspring as a model of healthy aging and summarizes available knowledge on three basic biological phenomena, i.e. age-related X chromosome inactivation skewing, gut microbiome changes and maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA genetic variants. In conclusion, an appropriate gender-specific medicine approach is urgently needed and should be systematically pursued in studies on healthy aging, longevity and age-related diseases, in a globalized world characterized by great gender differences which have a high impact on health and diseases.","review","","","","","XCI","cardiovascular, neurological, cancer, type 2 diabetes, disability, autoimmune, infection","","","","","","relevant"

A. and Müller, I. and Mählich, D. and Veltman, C. and Niehoff, A. and Wirth, B.","For a long time, PLS3 (plastin 3, also known as T-plastin or fimbrin) has been considered a rather inconspicuous protein, involved in F-actin-binding and -bundling. However, in recent years, a plethora of discoveries have turned PLS3 into a highly interesting protein involved in many cellular processes, signaling pathways, and diseases. PLS3 is localized on the X-chromosome, but shows sex-specific, inter-individual and tissue-specific expression variability pointing towards skewed X-inactivation. PLS3 is expressed in all solid tissues but usually not in hematopoietic cells. When escaping X-inactivation, PLS3 triggers a plethora of different types of cancers. Elevated PLS3 levels are considered a prognostic biomarker for cancer and refractory response to therapies. When it is knocked out or mutated in humans and mice, it causes osteoporosis with bone fractures; it is the only protein involved in actin dynamics responsible for osteoporosis. Instead, when PLS3 is upregulated, it acts as a highly protective SMN-independent modifier in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Here, it seems to counteract reduced F-actin levels by restoring impaired endocytosis and disturbed calcium homeostasis caused by reduced SMN levels. In contrast, an upregulation of PLS3 on wild-type level might cause osteoarthritis. This emphasizes that the amount of PLS3 in our cells must be precisely balanced; both too much and too little can be detrimental. Actin-dynamics, regulated by PLS3 among others, are crucial in a lot of cellular processes including endocytosis, cell migration, axonal growth, neurotransmission, translation, and others. Also, PLS3 levels influence the infection with different bacteria, mycosis, and other pathogens.","experiment","PLS3","","","x","cell development","cancer, osteoporosis","","","","","","When escaping X-inactivation, PLS3 triggers a plethora of different types of cancers."

Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase 7 (CHST7), encoded by the X chromosome, is abnormally expressed during tumor development. However, its impact on colorectal cancer (CRC) and the effect of CHST7 methylation on sex-specific CRC risk remain unclear.AimsTo investigate the effect of CHST7 methylation in white blood cells on CRC risk and to evaluate its impact on gender-specific differences.MethodsCHST7 methylation in white blood cells was determined using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting. A propensity score analysis was performed to control potential confounders. Furthermore, extensive sensitivity analyses were applied to assess the robustness of our findings. In addition, we validated the initial findings with a GEO dataset (GSE51032).ResultsCHST7 hypermethylation in white blood cells was associated with an increased CRC risk [odds ratio (OR)(adj)=4.447, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.662-7.430; p<0.001]. The association was validated with the GEO dataset (ORadj=2.802, 95% CI 1.235-6.360; p=0.014). In particular, CHST7 hypermethylation significantly increased the CRC risk in females (ORadj=7.704, 95% CI 4.222-14.058; p<0.001) and younger patients (<= 60years) (ORadj=5.755, 95% CI 2.540-13.038; p<0.001). Subgroup analyses by tumor location and Duke's stage also observed these associations.ConclusionCHST7 methylation in white blood cells is positively associated with CRC risk, especially in females, and may potentially serve as a blood-based predictive biomarker for CRC risk.","experiment","CHST7","","","","","colorectal cancer, cancer","DNA methylation","-","","","",""

R.","A good deal of sex differences in kidney disease is attributable to sex differences in the function of genes on the X chromosome. Males are uniquely vulnerable to mutations in their single copy of X-linked genes, whereas females are often mosaic, having a mixture of cells expressing different sets of X-linked genes. This cellular mosaicism created by X inactivation in females is most often advantageous, protecting carriers of X-linked mutations from the severe clinical manifestations seen in males. Even subtle differences in expression of many of the 1100 X-linked genes may contribute to sex differences in the clinical expression of renal diseases.

Although genes that cause AS are well characterized, people with AS who have similar genetic mutations present with a wide variation in the extent of kidney impairment and age of onset, suggesting the activities of modifier genes. METHODS: We created a cohort of genetically diverse XLAS male and female mice using the Diversity Outbred mouse resource and measured albuminuria, GFR, and gene expression. Using a quantitative trait locus approach, we mapped modifier genes that can best explain the underlying phenotypic variation measured in our diverse population. RESULTS: Genetic analysis identified several loci associated with the variation in albuminuria and GFR, including a locus on the X chromosome associated with X inactivation and a locus on chromosome 2 containing Fmn1. Subsequent analysis of genetically reduced Fmn1 expression in Col4a5 knockout mice showed a decrease in albuminuria, podocyte effacement, and podocyte protrusions in the glomerular basement membrane, which support the candidacy of Fmn1 as a modifier gene for AS. CONCLUSION: With this novel approach, we emulated the variability in the severity of kidney phenotypes found in human patients with Alport Syndrome through albuminuria and GFR measurements. This approach can identify modifier genes in kidney disease that can be used as novel therapeutic targets.","experiment","COL4A5, Fmn1","","","","albuminuria production","x-linked alport syndrome (xlas), kidney","","mice","","x","",""

This study also demonstrated the presence of p190 transcript in nine out of 13 study patients. A longer follow-up analysis is needed to clarify the prognostic value of these results. The recent observation that clonal cytogenetic abnormalities may occur in CML patients in polyclonal remission after imatinib suggests that a neoplastic stem cell lacking BCR/ABL rearrangement may acquire further cytogenetic alterations other than Philadelphia chromosome.","experiment","BCR/ABL","","","","haematopoiesis","leukemia, cancer","","","","","",""

Whilst ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is recognized as the main etiological factor, the relationship between exposure and host phenotype is still unclear. We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane databases for studies assessing the genetic basis of host response to UVR DNA damage, the effect of UVR on generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and their detoxification, UVR induced skin immunity modifications, and the role of genomic instability with a focus on the potential use of these biomarkers to the surgical treatment planning and prognosis of BCC patients. Data suggest that risk for BCC development is likely to result from the combined effect of many genes, each with a relatively weak individual contribution. Certain genomic alterations have been associated with increased or reduced risk for BCC development, with a second primary BCC or with recurrence of BCC. However, use of these biomarkers in everyday practice should be supported by further studies, mainly for its cost-effectiveness. In addition, not enough information exists on the prognostic value of existing demographic and clinical risk predictors for BCC regarding development of second primary or recurrent tumors. Information reviewed suggests that these predictors are of higher predictive value compared with biomarkers whilst they are indisputably cheaper and easier to monitor even in developing countries. Conclusively, we suggest that further studies aimed in investigating second primary or recurrent BCC are needed to provide better information on the predictive value of certain demographic, clinical and histological factors. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, very recent studies have unraveled striking differences between cells carrying XX or XY chromosomes in terms of response to stressful stimuli, indicating the presence of genetic and epigenetic differences determining sex-specific metabolic or phenotypic traits. Although this field of investigation is still in its infancy, available data suggest a key role of sexual chromosomes in determining cell life or death. In particular, cells carrying XX chromosomes exhibit a higher adaptive potential and survival behavior in response to microenvironmental variations with respect to XY cells. Cells from females also appear to be equipped with more efficient epigenetic machinery than the male counterpart. In particular, the X chromosome contains an unexpected high number of microRNAs (miRs), at present 118, in comparison with only two miRs localized on chromosome Y, and an average of 40-50 on the autosomes. The regulatory power of these small non-coding RNAs is well recognized, as 30-50% of all protein-coding genes are targeted by miRs and their role in cell fate has been well demonstrated. In addition, several further insights, including DNA methylation patterns that are different in males and females, claim for a significant gender disparity in cancer and in the immune system activity against tumors. In this brief paper, we analyze the state of the art of our knowledge on the implication of miRs encoded on sex chromosomes, and their related functional paths, in the regulation of cell homeostasis and depict possible perspectives for the epigenetic research in the field.","review","x","x","","","epigenetics","cancer","microRNAs","","","","",""
