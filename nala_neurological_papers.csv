The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) is involved in X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female placental mammals, a process that ensures the balanced expression dosage of X-linked genes between sexes. XIST is abnormally expressed in many sex-biased diseases. In addition, escape from XIST-mediated XCI and skewed XCI also contribute to sex-biased diseases. Therefore, its expression or modification can be regarded as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of many sex-biased diseases. Genetic manipulation of XIST expression can inhibit the progression of some of these diseases in animal models, and therefore XIST has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target. In this manuscript, we summarize the current knowledge about the mechanisms for XIST-mediated XCI and the roles of XIST in sex-biased diseases, and discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting XIST.","review","Xist","","","","XCI, Xist regulation","autoimmune, neurological, pulmonary hypertension, cancer","","","","","","very relevant, exactly what we want to write"

Mutations in the MECP2 gene were identified in approximately 70-80% of sporadic Rett syndrome cases. Methods - We have screened the MECP2 gene coding region for mutations in five familial cases of Rett syndrome and studied the patterns of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in each girl. Results - We found a mutation in MECP2 in only one family. In the four families without mutation in MECP2, we found that (1) all mothers exhibit a totally skewed pattern of XCI; (2) six out of eight affected girls also have a totally skewed pattern of XCI; and (3) it is the paternally inherited X chromosome which is active in the patients with a skewed pattern of XCI. Given that the skewing of XCI is inherited in our families, we genotyped the whole X chromosome using 32 polymorphic markers and we show that a locus potentially responsible for the skewed XCI in these families could be located on the short arm of the X chromosome. Conclusion - These data led us to propose a model for familial Rett syndrome transmission in which two traits are inherited, an X linked locus abnormally escaping X chromosome inactivation and the presence of a skewed XCI in carrier women.","experiment","MECP2","x","","","skewed XCI, EXCI","rett syndrome, neurological","","pedigree","","","","relevant"

The idiosyncratic expression profile associated with imprinted genes arises from the differential epigenetic marking of the alleles in the paternal and maternal germlines. Although small in number, imprinted genes can profoundly influence key developmental and physiological processes, including those in the brain; work in animal models and in humans has shown that such genes can affect behavioral traits and cognition and may confer vulnerability to common mental illnesses. As a consequence of how the X chromosome is inherited, X-linked imprinting may elicit or indeed attenuate sexually dimorphic phenotypes.

Accumulating experimental evidence suggests that onset and mechanistic principles of post-nerve injury processes are sexually dimorphic. We examined largely understudied aspects of early transcriptional events in DRG within 24 h after sciatic nerve axotomy in mice of both sexes. Using high-depth RNA sequencing (>50 million reads/sample) to pinpoint sexually dimorphic changes related to regeneration, immune response, bioenergy, and sensory functions, we identified a higher number of transcriptional changes in male relative to female DRG. In males, the decline in ion channel transcripts was accompanied by the induction of innate immune cascades via TLR, chemokine, and Csf1-receptor axis and robust regenerative programs driven by Sox, Twist1/2, and Pax5/9 transcription factors. Females demonstrated nerve injury-specific transcriptional co-activation of the actinin 2 network. The predicted upstream regulators and interactive networks highlighted the role of novel epigenetic factors and genetic linkage to sex chromosomes as hallmarks of gene regulation post-axotomy. We implicated epigenetic X chromosome inactivation in the regulation of immune response activity uniquely in females. Sexually dimorphic regulation of MMP/ADAMTS metalloproteinases and their intrinsic X-linked regulator Timp1 contributes to extracellular matrix remodeling integrated with pro-regenerative and immune functions. Lexis1 non-coding RNA involved in LXR-mediated lipid metabolism was identified as a novel nerve injury marker.

Women have been historically under-recruited or excluded from clinical trials, and most basic research uses male rodent cells or animals as disease models, rarely studying both sexes and factoring sex as a potential source of variation, resulting in a poor understanding of the underlying biological reasons for sex and gender differences in the development of such diseases. Putative pathophysiological contributors include hormones and epigenetics regulators but additional biological and non-biological influences may be at play. We review here the evidence for the underpinning role of the sex chromosome complement, X chromosome inactivation, and environmental and epigenetic regulators in sex differences in the vulnerability to brain disease. We conclude that there is a pressing need for a better understanding of the genetic, epigenetic and environmental mechanisms sustaining sex differences in such diseases, which is critical for developing a precision medicine approach based on sex-tailored prevention and treatment.","review","","","","","","neurological","","","","","","A review on XCI in neurological diseases.

Progressive intralysosomal accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids in a variety of cell types triggers a cascade of pathophysiological events including cellular death, compromised energy metabolism, small vessel injury, K(Ca)3.1 channel dysfunction in endothelial cells, oxidative stress, impaired autophagosome maturation, tissue ischemia and, importantly, development of irreversible cardiac and renal tissue fibrosis, leading to major multisystemic manifestations. Cardiovascular complications of the disease are very frequent and contribute substantially to disease-related morbidity and mortality in men. Cardiovascular involvement is the leading cause of premature death in heterozygous female patients with FD. Left ventricular hypertrophy is the most prominent cardiac manifestation followed by conduction system disease, valve dysfunction, arrhythmias, vessel disease and coronary microvascular dysfunction. The diagnosis of subclinical forms of the disease, before the development of cardiac hypertrophy, using newer techniques (tissue doppler imaging, strain rate and cardiac magnetic resonance) is crucial to the early initation of the treatment. Greatest benefit of the enzyme replacement treatment is achieved when started at an early stage of the disease before extensive fibrosis or other irreversible tissue damage takes place. Fabry disease should be included in the differential diagnosis algorithm of idiopathic hypertrophy.

Some of the differences can be explained by the action of sex hormones, but the experiments on four core genotype mouse model, in which XX and XY mice can be of either sex showed that not all differences are due to hormones. An example of a disease with no simple explanation of sex bias is Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, a mitochondrial disease with about 4:1 male to female ratio.

As part of this question we asked whether mouse X-Y homologous gene pairs are expressed in brain in a sex-specific fashion. Using RT-PCR and northern blot analysis, we assessed mRNA expression in brain of eight Y-linked genes as well as their X-linked homologues, at three ages: 13.5 days post coitum, the day of birth (P1) and adult. Transcripts of six Y genes were expressed at one or more ages: Usp9y, Ube1y, Smcy, Eif2s3y, Uty and Dby. Their expression also occurred in XY female brain, and therefore does not require testicular secretions. Six X-linked homologues (Usp9x, Ube1x, Smcx, Eif2s3x, Utx and Dbx) were also expressed in brain, and in adulthood all of these transcripts were expressed at significantly higher levels in brains of females than in brains of males, irrespective of their X-inactivation status. For five of these gene pairs, the expression of the Y-linked homologue in males was not sufficient to compensate for the female bias in X gene expression. Three X-Y gene pairs, Usp9x/y, Ube1x/y and Eif2s3x/y, appeared to be differentially regulated (expressed in brain in a different age- or tissue-dependent pattern), and hence may not be functionally equivalent. These sex differences in X-Y gene expression suggest several mechanisms by which these genes may participate in sex differences in brain development and function.","experiment","Usp9y, Ube1y, Smcy, Eif2s3y, Uty and Dby","x","","","cellular","neurological","","","","","",""

G.","We have reviewed and plan full reports on a total of 529 cases of NTDs in 513 families from genetics and spina bifida clinics in British Columbia. We were interested in the level of NTD to correlate variables with primary neurulation versus secondary neurulation (canalisation) defects. 299 (57%) of our cases were primary neurulation defects (ie, had cranial or vertebral defects above T12) and 230 (43%) were secondary neurulation or canalisation defects (ie, had no recognisable vertebral defect above L1). The cases were also distinguished by presence or absence of additional congenital anomalies. 20% of the primary neurulation defects had additional congenital anomalies, while there was no increase in congenital anomalies among the canalisation defect group. The M/F sex ratio for all isolated NTDs (ie, without additional anomalies), including both neurulation and canalisation defects, was 0.83, while that of all NTDs with additional anomalies was 1.2. The sex ratio for isolated cases of all primary neurulation defects was 0.65. The sex ratio for all other categories of NTDs (except the very small group of multiple neural tube defects with anomalies) was greater than or close to 1.0 or had been skewed away from 1.0 by having isolated primary NTDs within the category. Thus our data resemble those of Martinez Frias et al. We did not find the excess of females only in the group of NTDs with abnormal thoracic and cervical vertebrae which Seller observed in her pathological specimens; in our clinic population there was an excess of females among isolated primary neurulation defects of all types. This difference may be related to the fact that most of our cases were term deliveries or liveborn rather than terminations. Seller and James have suggested that female embryos develop more slowly than males, making them susceptible to failure of proper neural tube formation. We would like to suggest that some component of the slower early embryological development seen in females may be secondary to delayed X inactivation, of some or all of an X chromosome in some or all of the cells of the female embryos with NTDs. Late inactivation would make those cells in the developing embryo aneuploid with regard to the X chromosome by virtue of having two active X chromosomes. A variety of human aneuploidies predispose to NTDs. Aneuploid cells would be expected to divide more slowly than normal (eg, more slowly than male cells or female cells which have completed normal inactivation of one X). A slower rate of cell division and tissue growth would be expected to predispose to failure of neural tube closure (primary neurulation). This hypothesis should be testable in mice with appropriate X chromosome markers to demonstrate X inactivation or lack thereof in early embryo development.","experiment","","","","","cell development","neurological, neural tube defects (ntd)","","","","","",""

The phenotypes associated with DDX3X variants are heterogeneous and include brain and behavioral abnormalities, microcephaly, hypotonia, and movement disorders and/or spasticity. The majority of DDX3X variants described are de novo mutations in females with ID. In contrast, most male DDX3X variants are inherited from an unaffected mother, with one documented exception being a recently identified de novo splice site variant. It has been suggested, therefore, that DDX3X exerts its effects through haploinsufficiency in females, and that affected males carry hypomorphic alleles that retain partial function. Given the lack of male de novo DDX3X variants, loss-of-function variants in this gene are suspected to be male lethal. Through whole-exome sequencing, we identified three unrelated males with hemizygous missense DDX3X variants and ID. All three variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, with two established as de novo. In silico analyses were supportive of pathogenicity. We report the male phenotypes and compare them to phenotypes observed in previously reported male and female patients.
