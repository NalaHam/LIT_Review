67,Why Females Do Better: The X Chromosomal TLR7 Gene-Dose Effect in COVID-19,2021,Front Immunol,"Spiering, A. E. and de Vries, T. J.","A male sex bias has emerged in the COVID-19 pandemic, fitting to the sex-biased pattern in other viral infections. Males are 2.84 times more often admitted to the ICU and mortality is 1.39 times higher as a result of COVID-19. Various factors play a role in this, and novel studies suggest that the gene-dose of Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 7 could contribute to the sex-skewed severity. TLR7 is one of the crucial pattern recognition receptors for SARS-CoV-2 ssRNA and the gene-dose effect is caused by X chromosome inactivation (XCI) escape. Female immune cells with TLR7 XCI escape have biallelic TLR7 expression and produce more type 1 interferon (IFN) upon TLR7 stimulation. In COVID-19, TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is one of the pattern recognition receptors responsible for IFN production and a delayed IFN response has been associated with immunopathogenesis and mortality. Here, we provide a hypothesis that females may be protected to some extend against severe COVID-19, due to the biallelic TLR7 expression, allowing them to mount a stronger and more protective IFN response early after infection. Studies exploring COVID-19 treatment via the TLR7-mediated IFN pathway should consider this sex difference. Various factors such as age, sex hormones and escape modulation remain to be investigated concerning the TLR7 gene-dose effect.",experiment,TLR7,,,x,IFN production,COVID-19,,,,,,very relevant

The precise mechanisms driving these sex differences in immunity are unknown. To investigate possible genetic factors, we quantify escape from X chromosome inactivation (XCI) for TLR7 and four other genes (RPS6KA3, CYBB, BTK, and IL13RA1) at the single plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) level. We observe escape from XCI for all investigated genes, leading to biallelic expression patterns. pDCs with biallelic gene expression have significantly higher mRNA levels of the respective genes. Unstimulated pDCs with biallelic TLR7 expression exhibit significantly higher IFNα/β mRNA levels, and IFNα exposure results in significantly increased IFNα/β protein production by pDCs. These results identify unanticipated heterogeneity in escape from XCI of several genes in pDCs and highlight the important contribution of X chromosome factors to sex differences in type I IFN responses, which might explain observed sex differences in human diseases.",experiment,"TLR7, RPS6KA3, CYBB, BTK, IL13RA1",,,,IFN production,autoimmune,,mRNA ,,,,very relevant
68,Sex Differences in Primary HIV Infection: Revisiting the Role of TLR7-Driven Type 1 IFN Production by Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells in Women,2021,Front Immunol,"Guéry, J. C.","Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce type I interferon (IFN-I) during HIV-1 infection in response to TLR7 stimulation. However, IFN-I-signaling has been shown to play opposite effects in HIV-1 and SIV infection. TLR7-driven type I interferon production in pDCs is higher in women than in men due to the cell-intrinsic actions of estrogen and X-chromosome complement. Indeed, TLR7 is encoded on the X-chromosome, and the TLR7 gene escapes the X-chromosome inactivation in immune cells of women which express significantly higher levels of TLR7 protein than male cells. Following HIV infection, women have a lower viremia during acute infection and exhibit stronger antiviral responses than men, which has been attributed to the increased capacity of female pDCs to produce IFN-α upon TLR7-stimulation. However, a deleterious functional impact of an excessive TLR7 response on acute viremia in women has been recently revealed by the analysis of the frequent rs179008 c.32A>T SNP of TLR7. This SNP was identified as a sex-specific protein abundance quantitative trait locus (pQTL) causing a difference in the TLR7 protein dosage and effector function in females only. T allele expression was associated with a lower TLR7 protein synthesis, blunted production of IFN-α by pDCs upon TLR7 stimulation, and an unexpectedly lower viral load during primary HIV-1 infection in women. In the present review, the author will revisit the role of TLR7-driven pDC innate function in the context of HIV-1 infection to discuss at what stage of primary HIV-1 infection the TLR7 rs179008 T allele is likely to be protective in women.",review,TLR7,,,x,IFN production,HIV,,,,,,very relevant

In this study, we investigated the expression and function of the long noncoding RNA FTX (lnc-FTX), an X-inactive-specific transcript (XIST) regulator transcribed from the X chromosome inactivation center, in both HCC and HCC gender disparity. lnc-FTX is expressed at higher levels in female livers than in male livers and is significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues. Patients with higher lnc-FTX expression exhibited longer survival, suggesting that lnc-FTX is a useful prognostic factor for HCC patients. lnc-FTX inhibits HCC cell growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, lnc-FTX represses Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity by competitively sponging miR-374a and inhibits HCC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion. In addition, lnc-FTX binds to the DNA replication licensing factor MCM2, thereby impeding DNA replication and inhibiting proliferation in HCC cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that lnc-FTX may act as a tumor suppressor in HCC through physically binding miR-374a and MCM2.

B.","Sex is a key risk factor for many types of cardiovascular disease. It is imperative to understand the mechanisms underlying sex differences to devise optimal preventive and therapeutic approaches for all individuals. Both biological sex (determined by sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones) and gender (social and cultural behaviors associated with femininity or masculinity) influence differences between men and women in disease susceptibility and pathology. Here, we focus on the application of experimental mouse models that elucidate the influence of 2 components of biological sex - sex chromosome complement (XX or XY) and gonad type (ovaries or testes). These models have revealed that in addition to well-known effects of gonadal hormones, sex chromosome complement influences cardiovascular risk factors, such as plasma cholesterol levels and adiposity, as well as the development of atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension. One mechanism by which sex chromosome dosage influences cardiometabolic traits is through sex-biased expression of X chromosome genes that escape X inactivation. These include chromatin-modifying enzymes that regulate gene expression throughout the genome. The identification of factors that determine sex-biased gene expression and cardiometabolic traits will expand our mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular disease processes and provide insight into sex differences that remain throughout the lifespan as gonadal hormone levels alter with age.`",experiment,,chromatin-modifying enzymes,,x,EXCI,"cardiovascular, cardiac, adiposity, atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension",x,,,,,very relevant

H. and Orjalo, A. V., Jr. and Johansson, H. E. and Han, J. H. and Imanishi-Kari, T.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the production of anti-nuclear antibodies. SLE is one of many autoimmune disorders that have a strong gender bias, with 70-90% of SLE patients being female. Several explanations have been postulated to account for the severity of autoimmune diseases in females, including hormonal, microbiota, and gene dosage differences. X-linked toll-like receptors (TLRs) have recently been implicated in disease progression in females. Our previous studies using the 564Igi mouse model of SLE on a Tlr7 and Tlr9 double knockout background showed that the presence of Tlr8 on both X chromosomes was required for the production of IgG autoantibodies, Ifn-I expression and granulopoiesis in females. Here, we show the results of our investigation into the role of Tlr8 expression in SLE pathogenesis in 564Igi females. Female mice have an increase in serum pathogenic anti-RNA IgG2a and IgG2b autoantibodies. 564Igi mice have also been shown to have an increase in neutrophils in vivo, which are major contributors to Ifn-Œ± expression. Here, we show that neutrophils from C57BL/6 mice express Ifn-Œ± in response to 564 immune complexes and TLR8 activation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from 564Igi females have a significant increase in Tlr8 expression compared to male-derived cells, and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization data suggest that Tlr8 may escape X-inactivation in female-derived macrophages. These results propose a model by which females may be more susceptible to SLE pathogenesis due to inefficient inactivation of Tlr8.",experiment,Tlr8,,,,EXCI,Systemic lupus erythematosus,,mice,,,,relevant

Here we report the identification, in a single centre, of two females with ATMDS and mutations in the ATRX gene, proving that ATMDS associated with such mutations may occur, albeit rarely, in females. It seemed possible that females might be less likely to develop ATMDS if the inactivated copy of the ATRX gene (ATRX) became progressively re-activated throughout life.

Inter-female and twin data supported a model of predominately cis-acting influences on inactivation status. The level of expression from the inactive X relative to the active X correlated with the amount of female promoter DNAm to a threshold of ~30%, beyond which genes were consistently subject to inactivation.

Accordingly, miR-548am-5p target mRNAs, e.g. the transcript for Bax, was differently modulated in XX and XY DFs. Functional analyses indicated that XY DFs were more prone to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis than XX ones. Experimentally induced overexpression of miR548am-5p in XY cells by lentivirus vector transduction decreased apoptosis susceptibility, whereas its down-regulation in XX cells enhanced apoptosis susceptibility.

SLE incidence in female is substantially higher than males, but males tend to have more severe manifestations including greater risk of lupus nephritis (LN). Aberrant genetic expression of immune cells plays a vital role in pathogenesis of SLE and may explain gender diapariesties. We conducted bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SLE females and males with and without LN to identify gene differences and possible sex-tailored treatment. The gene expression profiling datasets (GSE 99967) were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo and analyzed by GEO2R platform. GSE 99967 used ffymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array and mRNA from whole blood.

XIST was the only down-regulated gene in male, located at X chromosome and responsible for initiation and spread of X-inactivation. X inactivation provides XIST dosage equivalence between genders. This suggested altered X-chromosome inactivation lead to female bias in SLE. Of 12 common up-regulated genes in male, 10 located at Y chromosome and showed a decrease up-regulated in SLE males with LN compare to without. A markly DEGs drop was found in TXLNGY, UTY and USP9Y, located at Yq 11.22. TXLNGY is a pseudo-gene so may not have roles in sex bias. UTY is a male-specific histone demethylase and USP9Y regulates level of protein turnover by preventing protein degradation including TGF-beta signaling. Change in UTY and USP9Y expression may associate with developing LN and drugs modifying their expression might benefit in treatment or prevention of LN in SLE males. The study enhanced an understanding of SLE sexual bias. Aberrant XIST inactivation may cause different incidence of SLE among gender. Drugs changing XIST expression might cure SLE.

Many explanations have been proposed, including sex hormones, the X chromosome, microchimerism, environmental factors, and the microbiome. However, the mechanism for this autoimmune sex bias remains obscure. In this manuscript, we evaluate the hypothesis that qualitative or quantitative differences in circulating antibodies may explain, at least in part, the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and its sex bias-especially when considering an evolutionary perspective. Indeed, women have higher absolute levels of antibodies than men, and (auto)antibodies are also associated with most autoimmune diseases. Several facts suggest differences in antibodies may cause increased prevalence of autoimmune disease in women. First, the association between increased quantities of serum antibodies and increased prevalence of autoimmunity is found not only in women, but also in men with Klinefelter syndrome. Second, both serum antibody levels and autoimmunity spike in the postpartum period. Third, a dose-response effect exists between parity and both serum antibodies and prevalence of autoimmune disease. Fourth, many biologically plausible mechanisms explain the association, such as T cell-dependent activation of B cells and/or VGLL3. The evolutionary underpinning of increased antibodies in women is likely to be protection of offspring from infections. Overall, this evolutionary paradigm can help explain why the phenomenon of autoimmunity occurs preferentially in women and raises the possibility of new treatment options.",review,,,,,antibodies,autoimmune,,,,,,relevant

S.","BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis is a sexually dimorphic disease, with women often presenting with sustained fibrosis and men with more extensive calcification. However, the intracellular molecular mechanisms that drive these clinically important sex differences remain underexplored. METHODS: Hydrogel biomaterials were designed to recapitulate key aspects of the valve tissue microenvironment and to serve as a culture platform for sex-specific valvular interstitial cells (VICs; precursors to profibrotic myofibroblasts). The hydrogel culture system was used to interrogate intracellular pathways involved in sex-dependent VIC-to-myofibroblast activation and deactivation. RNA sequencing was used to define pathways involved in driving sex-dependent activation. Interventions with small molecule inhibitors and siRNA transfections were performed to provide mechanistic insight into sex-specific cellular responses to microenvironmental cues, including matrix stiffness and exogenously delivered biochemical factors. RESULTS: In both healthy porcine and human aortic valves, female leaflets had higher baseline activation of the myofibroblast marker Œ±-smooth muscle actin compared with male leaflets. When isolated and cultured, female porcine and human VICs had higher levels of basal Œ±-smooth muscle actin stress fibers that further increased in response to the hydrogel matrix stiffness, both of which were higher than in male VICs. A transcriptomic analysis of male and female porcine VICs revealed Rho-associated protein kinase signaling as a potential driver of this sex-dependent myofibroblast activation. Furthermore, we found that genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation such as BMX and STS (encoding for Bmx nonreceptor tyrosine kinase and steroid sulfatase, respectively) partially regulate the elevated female myofibroblast activation through Rho-associated protein kinase signaling. This finding was confirmed by treating male and female VICs with endothelin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, factors that are secreted by endothelial cells and known to drive myofibroblast activation through Rho-associated protein kinase signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Together, in vivo and in vitro results confirm sex dependencies in myofibroblast activation pathways and implicate genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation in regulating sex differences in myofibroblast activation and subsequent aortic valve stenosis progression. Our results underscore the importance of considering sex as a biological variable to understand the molecular mechanisms of aortic valve stenosis and to help guide sex-based precision therapies.",experiment,"BMX, STS",,,,EXCI,"cardiac, Aortic valve stenosis ",,RNA sequencing,,,,relevant

Mutations in the MECP2 gene were identified in approximately 70-80% of sporadic Rett syndrome cases. Methods - We have screened the MECP2 gene coding region for mutations in five familial cases of Rett syndrome and studied the patterns of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in each girl. Results - We found a mutation in MECP2 in only one family. In the four families without mutation in MECP2, we found that (1) all mothers exhibit a totally skewed pattern of XCI; (2) six out of eight affected girls also have a totally skewed pattern of XCI; and (3) it is the paternally inherited X chromosome which is active in the patients with a skewed pattern of XCI. Given that the skewing of XCI is inherited in our families, we genotyped the whole X chromosome using 32 polymorphic markers and we show that a locus potentially responsible for the skewed XCI in these families could be located on the short arm of the X chromosome. Conclusion - These data led us to propose a model for familial Rett syndrome transmission in which two traits are inherited, an X linked locus abnormally escaping X chromosome inactivation and the presence of a skewed XCI in carrier women.",experiment,MECP2,x,,,"skewed XCI, EXCI","Rett syndrome, neurological",,pedigree,,,,relevant

Areas covered This paper provides an overview on the role of chromosome X (chrX) in explaining why females have higher susceptibility to autoimmunity. The work outlines some essential concepts regarding chrX inactivation, escape from chrX inactivation and the evolutionary history of chrX. In addition, we will discuss the concept of gene escape in immune cells, with examples related to specific X-linked genes and autoimmune diseases. Expert opinion There is growing evidence that many genes present on chrX escape inactivation, and some of them have significant immune-mediated functions. In immune cells of female individuals the escape of these genes is not constant, but the knowledge of the mechanisms controlling this plasticity are not completely understood. Future studies aimed at the characterization of these modifications at single-cell resolution, together with conformational 3D studies of the inactive X chromosome, will hopefully help to fill this gap of knowledge.",review,x,,,,EXCI,autoimmune,,,,,,relevant

In this report, we estimate the number of functional retrogenes on the lineage leading to humans generated by the high rate of retroposition (retroduplication) in primates. Extensive comparative sequencing and expression studies coupled with evolutionary analyses and simulations suggest that a significant proportion of recent retrocopies represent bona fide human genes. We estimate that at least one new retrogene per million years emerged on the human lineage during the past approximately 63 million years of primate evolution. Detailed analysis of a subset of the data shows that the majority of retrogenes are specifically expressed in testis, whereas their parental genes show broad expression patterns. Consistently, most retrogenes evolved functional roles in spermatogenesis. Proteins encoded by X chromosome-derived retrogenes were strongly preserved by purifying selection following the duplication event, supporting the view that they may act as functional autosomal substitutes during X-inactivation of late spermatogenesis genes. Also, some retrogenes acquired a new or more adapted function driven by positive selection. We conclude that retroduplication significantly contributed to the formation of recent human genes and that most new retrogenes were progressively recruited during primate evolution by natural and/or sexual selection to enhance male germline function.",data analysis,x,x,x,,,,,expression data,,,,

To test the impact of Xist RNA on X-linked gene silencing, we ectopically induced endogenous Xist by ablating the antisense repressor Tsix in mice. We find that ectopic Xist RNA induction and subsequent X-linked gene silencing is sex specific in embryos and in differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). A higher frequency of XΔTsixY male cells displayed ectopic Xist RNA coating compared with XΔTsixX female cells. This increase reflected the inability of XΔTsixY cells to efficiently silence X-linked genes compared with XΔTsixX cells, despite equivalent Xist RNA induction and coating. Silencing of genes on both Xs resulted in significantly reduced proliferation and increased cell death in XΔTsixX female cells relative to XΔTsixY male cells. Thus, whereas Xist RNA can inactivate the X chromosome in females it may not do so in males. We further found comparable silencing in differentiating XΔTsixY and 39,XΔTsix (XΔTsixO) ESCs, excluding the Y chromosome and instead implicating the X-chromosome dose as the source of the sex-specific differences. Because XΔTsixX female embryonic epiblast cells and EpiSCs harbor an inactivated X chromosome prior to ectopic inactivation of the active XΔTsix X chromosome, we propose that the increased expression of one or more X-inactivation escapees activates Xist and, separately, helps trigger X-linked gene silencing.",experiment,xist,x,,x,Xist,,Tsix repressor,mice,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to confirm a role for XCI skewing as a potential explanation for the strong female preponderance seen in AITD. DESIGN: The design of the study was to screen XCI in the largest GD, HT, and control case-control cohort and family cohort to date and undertake a meta-analysis of previous AITD XCI reports. SETTING: The study was conducted at a research laboratory. PATIENTS: Three hundred and nine GD, 490 HT, and 325 female UK Caucasians controls, 273 UK Caucasian GD families, and a meta-analysis of 454 GD, 673 HT, and 643 female Caucasian controls were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Case-control and family-based association studies and meta-analysis were measured. RESULTS: Skewed XCI was observed with GD [odds ratio (OR) 2.17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-3.30], P=2.1×10(-4)] and a trend toward skewing with HT (P=.08) compared with the control cohort. A meta-analysis of our UK data and that of four previous non-UK Caucasian studies confirmed significant skewing of XCI with GD [OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.58-4.10), P=1.0×10(-4), I2=30.2%] and HT [OR 2.40 (95% CI 1.10-5.26), P=.03, I2=74.3%]. CONCLUSIONS: Convincing evidence exists to support a role for skewed XCI in female subjects with AITD, which may, in part, explain the strong female preponderance observed in this disease.","experiment, meta-analysis",,,,XCI skewage,,"autoimmune thyroid diseases, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis",,human study,,,,

E. and Diallo, D. A.","BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is important in the control of oxidant stress in erythrocytes, the host cells for Plasmodium falciparum. Mutations in this enzyme produce X-linked deficiency states associated with protection against malaria, notably in Africa where the A- form of G6PD deficiency is widespread. Some reports have proposed that heterozygous females with mosaic populations of normal and deficient erythrocytes (due to random X chromosome inactivation) have malaria resistance similar to or greater than hemizygous males with populations of uniformly deficient erythrocytes. These proposals are paradoxical, and they are not consistent with currently hypothesized mechanisms of protection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted large case-control studies of the A- form of G6PD deficiency in cases of severe or uncomplicated malaria among two ethnic populations of rural Mali, West Africa, where malaria is hyperendemic. Our results indicate that the uniform state of G6PD deficiency in hemizygous male children conferred significant protection against severe, life-threatening malaria, and that it may have likewise protected homozygous female children. No such protection was evident from the mosaic state of G6PD deficiency in heterozygous females. We also found no significant differences in the parasite densities of males and females with differences in G6PD status. Pooled odds ratios from meta-analysis of our data and data from a previous study confirmed highly significant protection against severe malaria in hemizygous males but not in heterozygous females. Among the different forms of severe malaria, protection was principally evident against cerebral malaria, the most frequent form of life-threatening malaria in these studies. CONCLUSIONS: The A- form of G6PD deficiency in Africa is under strong natural selection from the preferential protection it provides to hemizygous males against life-threatening malaria. Little or no such protection is present among heterozygous females. Although these conclusions are consistent with data from at least one previous study, they have not heretofore been realized to our knowledge, and they therefore give fresh perspectives on malaria protection by G6PD deficiency as an X-linked trait.",case controlled study,G6PD,,,,,malaria,,human study,,x,,

The idiosyncratic expression profile associated with imprinted genes arises from the differential epigenetic marking of the alleles in the paternal and maternal germlines. Although small in number, imprinted genes can profoundly influence key developmental and physiological processes, including those in the brain; work in animal models and in humans has shown that such genes can affect behavioral traits and cognition and may confer vulnerability to common mental illnesses. As a consequence of how the X chromosome is inherited, X-linked imprinting may elicit or indeed attenuate sexually dimorphic phenotypes. Thus, studying X-linked imprinting is likely to provide important general information about the evolutionary and mechanistic underpinnings of imprinting, as well as the molecular processes underlying sex-specific neurobiology and sex-biased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.",,,x,x,,imprinting,neurological,"yes, imprinting",,,,,

Y.","The X chromosome is known to play an important role in many sex-specific diseases. However, only a few single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the X chromosome have been found to be associated with diseases. Compared to the autosomes, conducting association tests on the X chromosome is more intractable due to the difference in the number of X chromosomes between females and males. On the other hand, X-chromosome inactivation takes place in female mammals, which is a phenomenon in which the expression of one copy of two X chromosomes in females is silenced in order to achieve the same gene expression level as that in males. In addition, imprinting effects may be related to certain diseases. Currently, there are some existing approaches taking X-chromosome inactivation into account when testing for associations on the X chromosome. However, none of them allows for imprinting effects. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a robust test, ZXCII, which accounts for both X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting effects without requiring specifying the genetic models in advance. Simulation studies are conducted in order to investigate the validity and performance of ZXCII under various scenarios of different parameter values. The simulation results show that ZXCII controls the type I error rate well when there is no association. Furthermore, with regards to power, ZXCII is robust in all of the situations considered and generally outperforms most of the existing methods in the presence of imprinting effects, especially under complete imprinting effects.",analysis test,,x,,,"XCI, imprinting",,imprinting,data analysis test,,,,Usefull test for future study?

L.","The number of human conditions that are currently considered to be autoimmune diseases (AID) has been steadily growing over the past decades and it is now estimated that over 10 million people are affected in the United States. One of the major shared features among AID is the predominance in the female sex which in some cases changes with the age at disease diagnosis. Numerous hypotheses have been formulated based on intuitive scientific backgrounds to justify this sex imbalance, i.e. sex hormones and reproductive factors, fetal microchimerism, other sex-related environmental factors, a skewing of the X-chromosome inactivation patterns, and major defects in sex chromosomes. Nevertheless, none of these hypotheses has thus far gathered enough convincing evidence and in most cases data are conflicting, as well illustrated by the reports on fetal microchimerism in systemic sclerosis or primary biliary cirrhosis. The present article will critically discuss the main hypotheses (loss of mosaicism, reactivation, and haploinsufficiency) that have been proposed based on findings in female patients with specific AID along with two additional mechanisms (X-chromosome vulnerability and X-linked polyamine genes) that have been observed in AID models. Further, recent data have significantly shifted the paradigm of X chromosome inactivation by demonstrating that a large number of genes can variably escape silencing on one or both chromosomes. As a result we may hypothesize that more than one mechanism may contribute to the female susceptibility to tolerance breakdown while the possibility that unknown factors may indeed protect men from AID should not be overlooked.",review,,x,,x,"loss of mosaicism, reactivation, haploinsufficiency, X-chromosome vulnerability, X-linked polyamine genes",autoimmune,,,,,,Might be good to separate papers based on male or female bias in disease

To better understand the pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases, an animal model is a good tool that can also help in developing novel therapeutics for diseases. Animal models of diseases can be divided into naturally occurring or induced by physical, chemical, or biological factors. Most human autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome (SS), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and multiple sclerosis (MS) have increased incidence and prevalence in females, but so far, sex differences and hormone therapy in spontaneous or chemical induced animal models of autoimmunity are not entirely clear.

In humans, females have a longer life span than males. The reasons for this are not entirely clear. The role of gender in the regulation of longevity may be linked to gender specific genetic differences, including the expression of sex hormone patterns and the changes in these patterns during an individual's lifetime. In addition, the effect of sex hormones on other physiologic responses to environmental influences on cellular stress and oxidative damage may play a role in longevity. Gender can impact many disease states, including autoimmune diseases, and the factors that affect the development of autoimmune diseases and the regulation of longevity may share common mechanistic pathways. Other factors that may play a role include telomere and telomerase related differences, caloric restriction and changes in mitochondrial DNA. Inflammatory and regulatory pathways such as insulin/IGF signaling and Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling may also play a role in longevity and aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer's.

A definite female predominance is found in many autoimmune diseases. Gender is also associated with differences in clinical presentation, onset, progression and outcome of autoimmune diseases. Sex hormones might influence the target organ's vulnerability to an autoimmune response. Gender differences also exist in organ specific autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Crohn's disease and celiac disease. Nevertheless, other organ specific autoimmune diseases (i.e. ulcerative colitis) are seemingly characterized with similar prevalence in both males and females. The reason for gender differences in certain autoimmune diseases remains unknown, but may be attributed to sex hormone influence, fetal microchimerism, X chromosome inactivation, and X chromosome abnormalities. Sex hormones have been found to have immune modulating properties, as well as providing cellular protection following tissue damage in certain circumstances. Sex hormones also influence innate and adaptive immune cells, number of B and T cells, antigen presentation and cytokine secretion.

Here, we examine genome-wide signatures of DNA methylation across fives tissues from a male and female koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), and present the first whole-genome, multi-tissue marsupial 'methylome atlas'. Using these novel data, we elucidate divergent versus common features of representative marsupial and eutherian DNA methylation.

Fourth, the sex-specific DNA methylation landscape upstream of Rsx, the primary lncRNA associated with marsupial XCI, is consistent with the epigenetic regulation of female-specific (and presumably inactive X chromosome-specific) expression.

I.","Peripheral nerve injury induces genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming of first-order neurons and auxiliary cells of dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Accumulating experimental evidence suggests that onset and mechanistic principles of post-nerve injury processes are sexually dimorphic. We examined largely understudied aspects of early transcriptional events in DRG within 24 h after sciatic nerve axotomy in mice of both sexes. Using high-depth RNA sequencing (>50 million reads/sample) to pinpoint sexually dimorphic changes related to regeneration, immune response, bioenergy, and sensory functions, we identified a higher number of transcriptional changes in male relative to female DRG. In males, the decline in ion channel transcripts was accompanied by the induction of innate immune cascades via TLR, chemokine, and Csf1-receptor axis and robust regenerative programs driven by Sox, Twist1/2, and Pax5/9 transcription factors. Females demonstrated nerve injury-specific transcriptional co-activation of the actinin 2 network. The predicted upstream regulators and interactive networks highlighted the role of novel epigenetic factors and genetic linkage to sex chromosomes as hallmarks of gene regulation post-axotomy. We implicated epigenetic X chromosome inactivation in the regulation of immune response activity uniquely in females. Sexually dimorphic regulation of MMP/ADAMTS metalloproteinases and their intrinsic X-linked regulator Timp1 contributes to extracellular matrix remodeling integrated with pro-regenerative and immune functions.

M. and O'Farrelly, C.","Type I interferons (IFN-I) and their cognate receptor, the IFNAR1/2 heterodimer, are critical components of the innate immune system in humans. They have been widely explored in the context of viral infection and autoimmune disease where they play key roles in protection against infection or shaping disease pathogenesis. A false dichotomy has emerged in the study of IFN-I where interferons are thought of as either beneficial or pathogenic. This 'good or bad' viewpoint excludes more nuanced interpretations of IFN-I biology - for example, it is known that IFN-I is associated with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, yet is also protective in the context of infectious diseases and contributes to resistance to viral infection. Studies have suggested that a shared transcriptomic signature underpins both potential resistance to viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmune disease. This seems to be particularly evident in females, who exhibit increased viral resistance and increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease. The molecular mechanisms behind such a signature and the role of sex in its determination have yet to be precisely defined. From a genomic perspective, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFN-I pathway have been associated with both infectious and autoimmune disease. While overlap between infection and autoimmunity has been described in the incidence of these SNPs, it has been overlooked in work and discussion to date. Here, we discuss the possible contributions of IFN-Is to the pathogenesis of infectious and autoimmune diseases. We comment on genetic associations between common SNPs in IFN-I or their signalling molecules that point towards roles in protection against viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmunity and propose that a shared transcriptomic and genomic immunological signature may underlie resistance to viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmunity in humans.

In humans, sexual dimorphism in the immune response has been well demonstrated, with females exhibiting lower infection rates than males for a variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. There is also a substantially increased incidence of autoimmune disease in females compared to males. Together, these trends indicate that females have a heightened immune reactogenicity to both self and non-self-molecular patterns. However, the molecular mechanisms driving the sexually dimorphic immune response are not fully understood.

Several studies have identified a sex-specific transcriptome and methylome, independent of the well-described phenomenon of X-chromosome inactivation, suggesting that sexual dimorphism also occurs at the epigenetic level. Moreover, distinct alterations to the transcriptome and epigenetic landscape occur in synchrony with periods of hormonal change, such as puberty, pregnancy, menopause, and exogenous hormone therapy. These changes are also mirrored by changes in immune cell function. This review will outline the evidence for sex hormones and pregnancy-associated hormones as drivers of epigenetic change, and how this may contribute to the sexual dimorphism. Determining the effects of sex hormones on innate immune function is important for understanding sexually dimorphic autoimmune diseases, sex-specific responses to pathogens and vaccines, and how innate immunity is altered during periods of hormonal change (endogenous or exogenous).",review,,x,,,sex hormones,autoimmune,x,,,,,
71,Sex Differences in Immunity: Implications for the Development of Novel Vaccines Against Emerging Pathogens,2020,Front Immunol,"Fathi, A. and Addo, M. M. and Dahlke, C.","Vaccines are one of the greatest public health achievements and have saved millions of lives. They represent a key countermeasure to limit epidemics caused by emerging infectious diseases. The Ebola virus disease crisis in West Africa dramatically revealed the need for a rapid and strategic development of vaccines to effectively control outbreaks. Seven years later, in light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this need has never been as urgent as it is today. Vaccine development and implementation of clinical trials have been greatly accelerated, but still lack strategic design and evaluation. Responses to vaccination can vary widely across individuals based on factors like age, microbiome, co-morbidities and sex. The latter aspect has received more and more attention in recent years and a growing body of data provide evidence that sex-specific effects may lead to different outcomes of vaccine safety and efficacy. As these differences might have a significant impact on the resulting optimal vaccine regimen, sex-based differences should already be considered and investigated in pre-clinical and clinical trials. In this Review, we will highlight the clinical observations of sex-specific differences in response to vaccination, delineate sex differences in immune mechanisms, and will discuss the possible resulting implications for development of vaccine candidates against emerging infections. As multiple vaccine candidates against COVID-19 that target the same antigen are tested, vaccine development may undergo a decisive change, since we now have the opportunity to better understand mechanisms that influence vaccine-induced reactogenicity and effectiveness of different vaccines.",review,,,,,immune system,vaccines,,,,,,Sex differences in vaccines
72,Sex differences in Mecp2-mutant Rett syndrome model mice and the impact of cellular mosaicism in phenotype development,2020,Brain Res,"Ribeiro, M. C. and MacDonald, J. L.","There is currently no effective treatment for Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe X-linked progressive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the transcriptional regulator MECP2. Because MECP2 is subjected to X-inactivation, most affected individuals are female heterozygotes who display cellular mosaicism for normal and mutant MECP2. Males who are hemizygous for mutant MECP2 are more severely affected than heterozygous females and rarely survive. Mecp2 loss-of-function is less severe in mice, however, and male hemizygous null mice not only survive until adulthood, they have been the most commonly studied model system. Although heterozygous female mice better recapitulate human RTT, they have not been as thoroughly characterized. This is likely because of the added experimental challenges that they present, including delayed and more variable phenotypic progression and cellular mosaicism due to X-inactivation. In this review, we compare phenotypes of Mecp2 heterozygous female mice and male hemizygous null mouse models. Further, we discuss the complexities that arise from the many cell-type and tissue-type specific roles of MeCP2, as well as the combination of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous disruptions that result from Mecp2 loss-of-function. This is of particular importance in the context of the female heterozygous brain, composed of a mixture of MeCP2+ and MeCP2- cells, the ratio of which can alter RTT phenotypes in the case of skewed X-inactivation. The goal of this review is to provide a clearer understanding of the pathophysiological differences between the mouse models, which is an essential consideration in the design of future pre-clinical studies.",review,MECP2,,,,MeCP2 functions,Rett syndrome,,mice,,x,,The goal of this review is to provide a clearer understanding of the pathophysiological differences between the mouse models

The contribution of genetic and epigenetic factors from the inactive X chromosome (Xi) are beginning to emerge as critical mediators of autoimmunity in females. Here, we ask how epigenetic features of the Xi change during disease development in B cells from the NZB/W F1 spontaneous mouse model of lupus, which is female-biased. We find that Xist RNA becomes increasingly mislocalized from the Xi with disease onset. While NZB/W F1 naïve B cells have H3K27me3 foci on the Xi, which are missing from healthy C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, these foci are progressively lost in stimulated B cells during disease. Using single-molecule RNA FISH, we show that the X-linked gene Tlr7 is biallelically expressed in ~20% of NZB/W F1 B cells, and that the amount of biallelic expression does not change with disease. We also present sex-specific gene expression profiles for diseased NZB/W F1 B cells, and find female-specific upregulation of 20 genes, including the autoimmunity-related genes Cxcl13, Msr1, Igj, and Prdm1.

Implementing an allele-specific approach to examine XCI, we report evidence that XCI in the human placenta is patchy, with large patches of either maternal or paternal X chromosomes inactivated. Further, using similar measurements, we show that this is in contrast to adult tissues, which generally exhibit mosaic X inactivation, where bulk samples exhibit both maternal and paternal X chromosome expression.

We identified transcription start sites of escapees (escTSSs) based on higher transcription levels in female cells using FANTOM5 CAGE data. Significant over-representations of YY1 transcription factor binding motif and ChIP-seq peaks around escTSSs highlighted its positive association with escapees.

The region analyzed (-1157 to +917) showed no in vitro sex-specific promoter activity. However, a minimal constitutional promoter was assigned to a region from -81 to +1, and a cis element from -41 to -15 regulates promoter activity. We showed that a nuclear factor binds to an element located at -30 to -25 (TTAAAG). A second sequence at -41 to -15 does not act as an enhancer and is unable to confer transcriptional activity to the Xist gene on its own.

A previous study using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data proposed that female human preimplantation embryos achieve dosage compensation by downregulating both Xs, a phenomenon named dampening of X expression. Using a novel pipeline on those data, we identified a decrease in the proportion of biallelically expressed X-linked genes during development, consistent with XCI. Moreover, we show that while the expression sum of biallelically expressed X-linked genes decreases with embryonic development, their median expression remains constant, rejecting the hypothesis of X dampening. In addition, analyses of a different dataset of scRNA-seq suggest the appearance of X-linked monoallelic expression by the late blastocyst stage in females, another hallmark of initiation of XCI. Finally, we addressed the issue of dosage compensation between the single active X and autosomes in males and females for the first time during human preimplantation development, showing emergence of X to autosome dosage compensation by the upregulation of the active X chromosome in both male and female embryonic stem cells.

Using the X chromosome in the sexually dimorphic mouse liver as a model, we provide a general framework for comparing base-resolution DNA methylation patterns across samples that have different chromosome numbers and ask at a systematic level if predictions by historical analyses of X-linked DNA methylation hold true at a base-resolution chromosome-wide level. We demonstrate that sex-specific methylation patterns on the X chromosome largely reflect the effects of XCI. While our observations concur with longstanding observations of XCI at promoter-proximal CpG islands, we provide evidence that sex-specific DNA methylation differences are not limited to CpG island boundaries. Moreover, these data support a model in which maintenance of CpG islands in the inactive state does not require complete regional methylation.

We used mice in which the testis-determining gene (Sry) was moved from the Y chromosome to an autosome (by deletion of Sry from the Y and subsequent insertion of an Sry transgene onto an autosome), so that the determination of testis development occurred independently of the complement of X or Y chromosomes. We compared XX and XY mice with ovaries (females) and XX and XY mice with testes (males). These comparisons allowed us to assess the effect of sex chromosome complement (XX vs XY) independent of gonadal status (testes vs ovaries) on sexually dimorphic neural and behavioral phenotypes. The phenotypes included measures of male copulatory behavior, social exploration behavior, and sexually dimorphic neuroanatomical structures in the septum, hypothalamus, and lumbar spinal cord. Most of the sexually dimorphic phenotypes correlated with the presence of ovaries or testes and therefore reflect the hormonal output of the gonads. We found, however, that both male and female mice with XY sex chromosomes were more masculine than XX mice in the density of vasopressin-immunoreactive fibers in the lateral septum.

Here, we examined the relationship between the length of the CAG-repeat in AR and different handedness phenotypes in a sample of healthy adults of both sexes (n = 1057). Since AR is located on the X chromosome, statistical analyses in women heterozygous for CAG-repeat lengths are complicated by X chromosome inactivation. We thus analyzed a sample of women that were homozygous for the CAG-repeat length (n = 77). Mixed-handedness in men was significantly associated with longer CAG-repeat blocks and women homozygous for longer CAG-repeats showed a tendency for stronger left-handedness. These results suggest that handedness in both sexes is associated with the AR CAG-repeat length, with longer repeats being related to a higher incidence of non-right-handedness. Since longer CAG-repeat blocks have been linked to less efficient AR function, these results implicate that differences in AR signaling in the developing brain might be one of the factors that determine individual differences in brain lateralization.",experiment,AR,,,,brain lateralization,,,human,,,x,

The dominant screen has produced six mutant lines, including both suppressors and enhancers of variegation. All are semidominant and five of the six are homozygous embryonic lethal. In one case, the homozygous lethality depends on sex: homozygous females die at midgestation and display abnormal DNA methylation of the X chromosome, whereas homozygous males are viable.

For sex chromosomes, we demonstrate a pattern of obligate dosage sensitivity among evolutionarily preserved X-Y homologs and update prevailing theoretical models for SCD compensation by detecting X-linked genes that increase expression with decreasing X-and/or Y-chromosome dosage. We further show that SCD-sensitive sex-chromosome genes regulate specific coexpression networks of SCD-sensitive autosomal genes with critical cellular functions and a demonstrable potential to mediate previously documented SCD effects on disease. These gene coexpression results converge with analysis of transcription factor binding site enrichment and measures of gene expression in murine knockout models to spotlight the dosage-sensitive X-linked transcription factor ZFX as a key mediator of SCD effects on wider genome expression.

89,Is human X chromosome inactivation a sex-determining device?,1985,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Chandra, H. S.","The evolutionary function of X chromosome inactivation is thought to be dosage compensation. However, there is, at present, little evidence to suggest that most X chromosome-linked genes require such compensation. Another view - that X chromosome inactivation may be related to sex determination - is examined here. Consider a hypothetical DNA sequence regulating a major structural gene concerned with the determination of maleness. If this regulatory sequence occurs in both X and Y chromosomes and if its copy number in the Y chromosome is significantly greater than in the X chromosome, then the male-determining properties of the Y chromosome could be attributed to this higher copy number. On the other hand, if the Y chromosome has the same copy number of this sequence as the X chromosome, it is difficult to see how determination of two sexes would occur under such circumstances because XX and XY genomes would then be indistinguishable in this regard. Such a situation seems to occur in the human species with respect to the banded krait minor satellite, a repetitious DNA sequence associated with sex determination. This apparent difficulty may be resolved if X chromosome inactivation renders regulatory as well as structural genes nonfunctional and thereby brings about a significant reduction in the effective copy number of X chromosome-linked DNA sequences concerned with sex determination. It is suggested that X chromosome inactivation brings about, in this manner, a critical inequality between XX and XY embryos and that sex determination in humans is a consequence of this inequality. An analogous situation appears to exist in certain insects in which inactivation of a haploid set of chromosomes (and presumably, therefore, a 50% reduction in the effective copy number of most genes) is associated with maleness. If this line of reasoning is correct, it would suggest that sex determination may be the primary function of X chromosome inactivation.",data analysis,,x,x,x,XCI,,,,,,,

A.","Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a sexually dimorphic cardiovascular disease that is driven by fibrosis and calcification of the aortic valve leaflets. Circulating inflammatory factors present in serum from AVS patients contribute to sex differences in valve fibro-calcification by driving the activation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) to myofibroblasts and/or osteoblast-like cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory factors contribute to sex-specific valve fibro-calcification remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified inflammatory factors present in serum samples from AVS patients that regulate sex-specific myofibroblast activation and osteoblast-like differentiation. After correlating serum proteomic datasets with clinical and in vitro myofibroblast datasets, we identified annexin A2 and cystatin C as candidate inflammatory factors that correlate with both AVS patient severity and myofibroblast activation measurements in vitro. Validation experiments utilizing hydrogel biomaterials as cell culture platforms that mimic the valve extracellular matrix confirmed that annexin A2 and cystatin C promote sex-specific VIC activation to myofibroblasts via p38 MAPK signaling. Additionally, annexin A2 and cystatin C increase osteoblast-like differentiation primarily in male VICs. Our results implicate serum inflammatory factors as potential AVS biomarkers that also contribute to sexually dimorphic AVS progression by driving VIC myofibroblast activation and/or osteoblast-like differentiation.

C. and Migeon, B. R.","In marsupials and eutherian mammals, X chromosome dosage compensation is achieved by inactivating one X chromosome in female cells; however, in marsupials, the inactive X chromosomes is always paternal, and some genes on the chromosome are partially expressed. To define the role of DNA methylation in maintenance of X chromosome inactivity, we examined loci for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase in a North American marsupial, the opossum Didelphis virginiana, by using genomic hybridization probes cloned from this species. We find that these marsupial genes are like their eutherian counterparts, with respect to sex differences in methylation of nuclease-insensitive (nonregulatory) chromatin. However, with respect to methylation of the nuclease-hypersensitive (regulatory) chromatin of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase locus, the opossum gene differs from those of eutherians, as the 5' cluster of CpG dinucleotides is hypomethylated in the paternal as well as the maternal gene. Despite hypomethylation of the 5' CpG cluster, the paternal allele, identified by an enzyme variant, is at best partially expressed; therefore, factors other than methylation are responsible for repression. In light of these results, it seems that the role of DNA methylation in eutherian X dosage compensation is to ""lock in"" the process initiated by such factors. Because of similarities between dosage compensation in marsupials and trophectoderm derivatives of eutherians, we propose that differences in timing of developmental events--rather than differences in the basic mechanisms of X inactivation--account for features of dosage compensation that differ among mammals.",experiment,x,x,x,x,XCI,,DNA methylation,,,x,,we propose that differences in timing of developmental events--rather than differences in the basic mechanisms of X inactivation--account for features of dosage compensation that differ among mammals.

Left ventricular hypertrophy is the most prominent cardiac manifestation followed by conduction system disease, valve dysfunction, arrhythmias, vessel disease and coronary microvascular dysfunction. The diagnosis of subclinical forms of the disease, before the development of cardiac hypertrophy, using newer techniques (tissue doppler imaging, strain rate and cardiac magnetic resonance) is crucial to the early initation of the treatment. Greatest benefit of the enzyme replacement treatment is achieved when started at an early stage of the disease before extensive fibrosis or other irreversible tissue damage takes place. Fabry disease should be included in the differential diagnosis algorithm of idiopathic hypertrophy. Determination of Alpha-Gal A activity on plasma and peripheral leukocytes in males and genetic testing in females are the diagnostic gold-standards. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",experiment,,,,,,Fabry disease,,,,,x,

Using a mouse model that segregates gonadal sex (ovaries and testes) from chromosomal sex (XX and XY), we showed that XX chromosome complement in combination with a high-fat diet led to enhanced weight gain in the presence of male or female gonads. We identified the genomic dosage of Kdm5c, an X chromosome gene that escapes X chromosome inactivation, as a determinant of the X chromosome effect on adiposity. Modulating Kdm5c gene dosage in XX female mice to levels that are normally present in males resulted in reduced body weight, fat content, and food intake to a degree similar to that seen with altering the entire X chromosome dosage. In cultured preadipocytes, the levels of KDM5C histone demethylase influenced chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq), gene expression (RNA-Seq), and adipocyte differentiation. Both in vitro and in vivo, Kdm5c dosage influenced gene expression involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, which is critical for adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue expansion. In humans, adipose tissue KDM5C mRNA levels and KDM5C genetic variants were associated with body mass. These studies demonstrate that the sex-dependent dosage of Kdm5c contributes to male/female differences in adipocyte biology and highlight X-escape genes as a critical component of female physiology.",experiment,KDM5C,,,x,cellular,adiposity,histone demethylase,"mRNA, gene variants",,,,

The mechanisms whereby androgen regulates gene expression in the SNB of adult rats are largely unknown, although a retrograde influence from the BC/LA muscles has been suggested to underlie the suppression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expression observed in SNB motoneurons after systemic androgen treatment. A mosaic paradigm was used to determine the site of action of androgen in the regulation of CGRP expression in SNB motoneurons. As a consequence of random X chromosome inactivation, androgenized female rats heterozygous for the tfm androgen receptor (AR) mutation ((XXtfm)-X-wt-mosaics) express a mosaic of androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive motoneurons in the SNB, whereas the BC/LA target musculature appears to be uniformly sensitive to androgens. In adult mosaics, testosterone administration resulted in a reduction in the proportion of androgen-sensitive cells expressing CGRP, whereas no such reduction was observed in the androgen-insensitive population, indicating that neuronal AR plays an essential role in the neuromuscular regulation of CGRP expression in these motoneurons. This provides the first in vivo demonstration of AR regulation of gene expression unambiguously localized to a neuronal population.",experiment,,,,,neuromuscular circuit,,,,,x,,

Sex-based respiratory differences are present at birth suggesting a strong genetic component. Our objective was to characterize early life sex-based genomic signatures determined by variable X-chromosome methylation in the airways. We compared male versus female genome-wide DNA methylation in nasal airway samples from newborns and infants aged 1-6 months (N = 12). We analyzed methylation signals across CpG sites mapped to each X-linked gene using an unsupervised classifier (principal components) followed by an internal evaluation and an exhaustive cross-validation. Results were validated in an independent population of children (N = 72) following the same algorithm. X-linked genes with significant sex-based differential methylation in the nasal airway of infants represented only about 50% of the unique protein coding transcripts. X-linked genes without significant sex-based differential methylation included genes with evidence of escaping X-inactivation and female-biased airway expression. These genes showed similar methylation patterns in males and females suggesting unbalanced X-chromosome dosage.

G. and Tiplady, K. and Scott, A. and Davis, S. R. and Spelman, R. J.","X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a process by which 1 of the 2 copies of the X chromosomes present in female mammals is inactivated. The transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome achieves dosage compensation between XX females and XY males and ensures equal expression of X-linked genes in both sexes. Although all mammals use this form of dosage compensation, the complex mechanisms that regulate XCI vary between species, tissues, and development. These mechanisms include not only varying levels of inactivation, but also the nature of inactivation, which can range from being random in nature to driven by parent of origin. To date, no data describing XCI in calves or adult cattle have been reported and we are reliant on data from mice to infer potential mechanisms and timings for this process. In the context of dairy cattle breeding and genomic prediction, the implications of X chromosome inheritance and XCI in the mammary gland are particularly important where a relatively small number of bulls pass their single X chromosome on to all of their daughters. We describe here the use of RNA-seq, whole genome sequencing and Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) genotypes to assess XCI in lactating mammary glands of dairy cattle. At a population level, maternally and paternally inherited copies of the X chromosome are expressed equally in the lactating mammary gland consistent with random inactivation of the X chromosome. However, average expression of the paternal chromosome ranged from 10 to 90% depending on the individual animal. These results suggest that either the mammary gland arises from 1 or 2 stem cells, or a nongenetic mechanism that skews XCI exists. Although a considerable amount of future work is required to fully understand XCI in cattle, the data reported here represent an initial step in ensuring that X chromosome variation is captured and used in an appropriate manner for future genomic selection.",experiment,,x,,,XCI,,,"RNA-seq, whole genome sequencing and Illumina BovineHD BeadChip,  dairy cattle",,x,,

However, in recent years, a plethora of discoveries have turned PLS3 into a highly interesting protein involved in many cellular processes, signaling pathways, and diseases. PLS3 is localized on the X-chromosome, but shows sex-specific, inter-individual and tissue-specific expression variability pointing towards skewed X-inactivation. PLS3 is expressed in all solid tissues but usually not in hematopoietic cells. When escaping X-inactivation, PLS3 triggers a plethora of different types of cancers. Elevated PLS3 levels are considered a prognostic biomarker for cancer and refractory response to therapies. When it is knocked out or mutated in humans and mice, it causes osteoporosis with bone fractures; it is the only protein involved in actin dynamics responsible for osteoporosis. Instead, when PLS3 is upregulated, it acts as a highly protective SMN-independent modifier in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Here, it seems to counteract reduced F-actin levels by restoring impaired endocytosis and disturbed calcium homeostasis caused by reduced SMN levels. In contrast, an upregulation of PLS3 on wild-type level might cause osteoarthritis. This emphasizes that the amount of PLS3 in our cells must be precisely balanced; both too much and too little can be detrimental. Actin-dynamics, regulated by PLS3 among others, are crucial in a lot of cellular processes including endocytosis, cell migration, axonal growth, neurotransmission, translation, and others.

To determine if methylation has a role in maintaining inactivity of X-linked genes which show tissue-specific expression, we examined the locus for blood clotting Factor IX. The analysis encompassed 91% of the HpaII and HhaI sites in the 41-kb region that includes the presumed promoter region, 5 kb of 5'- and 4 kb of 3'-flanking sequences. Although there are sex differences in methylation of the locus in leukocytes, the methylation pattern in liver, where the gene is expressed, is essentially the same for loci on the active and inactive X chromosome. The lack of differences in methylation of active and inactive genes makes it unlikely that methylation within the locus has a role in expression of the Factor IX gene. These findings, along with the absence of clustered CpG dinucleotides within the Factor IX locus, suggest that functional differences in DNA methylation related to X chromosome dosage compensation may be limited to CpG clusters.

We have previously reported that complete deficiency (CD) and partial deficiency (PD) in Japanese subjects resulted from two distinct mutations of the TBG gene, TBG-CDJ and TBG-PDJ, respectively. Recently, we encountered a female manifesting TBG-CD and herein investigated the molecular mechanisms. She was found to possess TBG-CDJ and common-type TBG (TBG-C) alleles by characterizing the TBG gene. Then, X-chromosome inactivation status was evaluated in her family members using a phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene, located on Xq13. Three TBG-CDJ heterozygotes and one unaffected female, confirmed to be PGK heterozygotes for a polymorphic BstXI site, were analyzed. Only the CD female was shown to undergo selective inactivation by examining the BstXI site in amplified products after digestion with a methylation sensitive enzyme, HpaII. Among an additional eight informative females with TBG deficiency, one heterozygous female for TBG-PDJ shared this selective inactivation pattern. Moreover, the X-chromosome with TBG-C was suggested to be inactivated selectively from the linkage of PGK and TBG alleles recognized in eight of nine family members.

Various factors, including sex hormones, the presence or absence of a second X chromosome, and sex-specific gut microbiota can influence gene expression in a sex-specific way. These changes in gene expression may, in turn, lead to susceptibility or protection from autoimmunity, creating a sex bias for autoimmune diseases.

X chromosome-dosage increases susceptibility to SLE and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Chromosome X open reading frame 21 (CXorf21) escapes X-inactivation and is an SLE risk gene of previously unknown function. We undertook the present study to delineate the function of CXorf21 in the immune system as well as investigate a potential role in the sex bias of SLE and pSS. Methods: Western blot protein analysis, qPCR, BioPlex cytokine immunoassay, pHrodo™ assays, as well as in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments were employed to delineate the role of CXorf21 in relevant immunocytes. Results: Expressed in monocytes and B cells, CXorf21 basal Mrna, and protein expression levels are elevated in female primary monocytes, B cells, and EBV-transformed B cells compared to male cells. We also found CXorf21 mRNA and protein expression is higher in both male and female cells from SLE patients compared to control subjects. TLR7 ligation increased CXorf21 protein expression and CXorf21 knockdown abrogated TLR7-driven increased IFNA1 mRNA expression, and reduced secretion of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 in healthy female monocytes. Similarly, we found increased pH in the lysosomes of CXorf21-deficient female monocytes. Conclusion: CXorf21 is more highly expressed in female compared to male cells and is involved in a sexually dimorphic response to TLR7 activation. In addition, CXorf21 expression regulates lysosomal pH in a sexually dimorphic manner.

A propensity score analysis was performed to control potential confounders. Furthermore, extensive sensitivity analyses were applied to assess the robustness of our findings. In addition, we validated the initial findings with a GEO dataset (GSE51032).ResultsCHST7 hypermethylation in white blood cells was associated with an increased CRC risk [odds ratio (OR)(adj)=4.447, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.662-7.430; p<0.001].

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) release IFN-α upon TLR7 and TLR9 ligation. With respect to the nine times higher incidence of SLE in women and the clinical use of synthetic TLR ligands as novel immune adjuvants, we analyzed IFN-α and TNF-α production in healthy human individuals. Blood samples were incubated with synthetic TLR7 and TLR9 ligands. In three independent groups (n1 = 120, n2 = 101, and n3 = 123), analysis revealed a capacity of female PBLs to produce significantly higher IFN-α levels after TLR7 stimulation (p1, < 0.0000001, p2 < 0.0000001, and p3 < 0.0001) compared with male PBLs. In contrast, no sex differences were evident after TLR9 stimulation. TNF-α production after TLR7 stimulation and also total pDC numbers were not different between females and males. X-inactivation escape of the TLR7 gene was investigated in monoclonal B cell lines and, independently, in pDCs after cell sorting and single-cell picking, indicating regular silencing of one TLR7 allele in females. Additionally, exogenous 17β-estrogen and estrogen receptor antagonism did not indicate a significant role on TLR7-induced IFN-α production. Our data reveal for the first time a profound sex-dependent pathway of TLR7-induced IFN-α with higher production in females.

Methods: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the HLA-A and HLA-C loci were genotyped. Main Outcome Measures: The Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test with Bonferroni correction were used.

We have utilized this technique to evaluate the behavior of the single X chromosome in oocytes from XO female mice, providing the first observations on segregation of an achiasmate chromosome during mammalian female meiosis and its effect on the meiotic process. As has been described in other species, we found that the univalent chromosome could either segregate as an intact chromosome to one pole or divide equationally at the first meiotic division. Our results also indicate that the presence of a univalent chromosome causes severe meiotic disruption during mammalian meiosis, affecting the alignment and segregation of other chromosomes in the complement. Despite these meiotic abnormalities, the vast majority of oocytes from XO females were able to resume and successfully complete the first meiotic division. This is in contrast to previous studies of male mice with sex chromosome abnormalities where the presence of a univalent acts to arrest meiosis at metaphase of the first meiotic division. This sex-specific difference in the ability of a cell with a univalent chromosome to initiate anaphase suggests that cell cycle central differs between male and female meiosis and that monitoring of meiotic chromosome behavior is less efficient in the female. The combined use of immunofluorescence staining and FISH on intact oocytes has obvious application to the study of meiotic chromosome non-disjunction in the human female. Simultaneous study of the meiotic cell cycle, protein components of the meiotic apparatus, and chromosome-specific behaviors during mammalian female meiosis provides a new approach to defining age-related changes in the meiotic process that result in increased chromosome malsegregation.",experiment,,,mammalian,,cell development,,,"FISH, mice",,,x,

METHODS: We created a cohort of genetically diverse XLAS male and female mice using the Diversity Outbred mouse resource and measured albuminuria, GFR, and gene expression. Using a quantitative trait locus approach, we mapped modifier genes that can best explain the underlying phenotypic variation measured in our diverse population. RESULTS: Genetic analysis identified several loci associated with the variation in albuminuria and GFR, including a locus on the X chromosome associated with X inactivation and a locus on chromosome 2 containing Fmn1. Subsequent analysis of genetically reduced Fmn1 expression in Col4a5 knockout mice showed a decrease in albuminuria, podocyte effacement, and podocyte protrusions in the glomerular basement membrane, which support the candidacy of Fmn1 as a modifier gene for AS. CONCLUSION: With this novel approach, we emulated the variability in the severity of kidney phenotypes found in human patients with Alport Syndrome through albuminuria and GFR measurements.

K. and Parsch, J.","Genes that are expressed differently between males and females (sex-biased genes) often show a nonrandom distribution in their genomic location, particularly with respect to the autosomes and the X chromosome. Previous studies of Drosophila melanogaster found a general paucity of male-biased genes on the X chromosome, although this is mainly limited to comparisons of whole flies or body segments containing the reproductive organs. To better understand the chromosomal distribution of sex-biased genes in various tissues, we used a common analysis framework to analyze microarray and RNA sequence data comparing male and female gene expression in individual tissues (brain, Malpighian tubule, and gonads), composite structures (head and gonadectomized carcass), and whole flies. Although there are relatively few sex-biased genes in the brain, there is a strong and highly significant enrichment of male-biased genes on the X chromosome. A weaker enrichment of X-linked male-biased genes is seen in the head, suggesting that most of this signal comes from the brain. In all other tissues, there is either no departure from the random expectation or a significant paucity of male-biased genes on the X chromosome. The brain and head also differ from other tissues in that their male-biased genes are significantly closer to binding sites of the dosage compensation complex. We propose that the interplay of dosage compensation and sex-specific regulation can explain the observed differences between tissues and reconcile disparate results reported in previous studies.",,,,,x,,,,Drosophila,,,x,

G.","Many single-locus, two-allele selection models of genomic imprinting have been shown to reduce formally to one-locus Mendelian models with a modified parameter for genetic dominance. One exception is the model where selection at the imprinted locus affects the sexes differently. We present two models of maternal inactivation with differential viability in the sexes, one with complete inactivation, and the other with a partial penetrance for inactivation. We show that, provided dominance relations at the imprintable locus are the same in both sexes, a globally stable polymorphism exists for a range of viabilities that is independent of the penetrance of imprinting. The conditions for a polymorphism are the same as in previous models with differential viability in the sexes but without imprinting and in a model of the paternal X-inactivation system in marsupials. The model with incomplete inactivation is used to illustrate the analogy between imprinting and dominance by comparing equilibrium bifurcation plots for fixed values of dominance and penetrance. We also derive a single expression for the dominance parameter that leaves the frequency and stability of equilibria unchanged for all levels of inactivation. Although an imprinting model with sex differences does not formally reduce to a nonimprinting scheme, close theoretical parallels clearly exist.",experiment,,imprinting,marsupials,,,,,,,,x,
164,The Placenta’s Role in Sexually Dimorphic Fetal Growth Strategies,2022,Reproductive Sciences,"Christians, J. K.","Fetal sex affects the risk of pregnancy complications and the long-term effects of prenatal environment on health. Some have hypothesized that growth strategies differ between the sexes, whereby males prioritize growth whereas females are more responsive to their environment. This review evaluates the role of the placenta in such strategies, focusing on (1) mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in gene expression, (2) the nature and extent of sexual dimorphism in placental gene expression, (3) sexually dimorphic responses to nutrient supply, and (4) sexual dimorphism in morphology and histopathology. The sex chromosomes contribute to sex differences in placental gene expression, and fetal hormones may play a role later in development. Sexually dimorphic placental gene expression may contribute to differences in the prevalence of complications such as preeclampsia, although this link is not clear. Placental responses to nutrient supply frequently show sexual dimorphism, but there is no consistent pattern where one sex is more responsive. There are sex differences in the prevalence of placental histopathologies, and placental changes in pregnancy complications, but also many similarities. Overall, no clear patterns support the hypothesis that females are more responsive to the maternal environment, or that males prioritize growth. While male fetuses are at greater risk of a variety of complications, total prenatal mortality is higher in females, such that males exposed to early insults may be more likely to survive and be observed in studies of adverse outcomes. Going forward, robust statistical approaches to test for sex-dependent effects must be more widely adopted to reduce the incidence of spurious results.",,,,,,cell development,pregnancy,,,,,x,

Even the nerve cells may die in different ways and exhibit different sensitivity to pro-apoptotic factors. Some of the differences can be explained by the action of sex hormones, but the experiments on four core genotype mouse model, in which XX and XY mice can be of either sex showed that not all differences are due to hormones. An example of a disease with no simple explanation of sex bias is Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, a mitochondrial disease with about 4:1 male to female ratio.

We aimed to distinguish genetic and hormonal regulators of sex differences in plasma lipid levels. Approach and Results - We assessed the role of gonadal hormones and sex chromosome complement on lipid levels using the four core genotypes mouse model (XX females, XX males, XY females, and XY males). In gonadally intact mice fed a chow diet, lipid levels were influenced by both male-female gonadal sex and XX-XY chromosome complement. Gonadectomy of adult mice revealed that the male-female differences are dependent on acute effects of gonadal hormones. In both intact and gonadectomized animals, XX mice had higher HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than XY mice, regardless of male-female sex. Feeding a cholesterol-enriched diet produced distinct patterns of sex differences in lipid levels compared with a chow diet, revealing the interaction of gonadal and chromosomal sex with diet. Notably, under all dietary and gonadal conditions, HDL-C levels were higher in mice with 2 X chromosomes compared with mice with an X and Y chromosome. By generating mice with XX, XY, and XXY chromosome complements, we determined that the presence of 2 X chromosomes, and not the absence of the Y chromosome, influences HDL-C concentration. Conclusions - We demonstrate that having 2 X chromosomes versus an X and Y chromosome complement drives sex differences in HDL-C. It is conceivable that increased expression of genes escaping X-inactivation in XX mice regulates downstream processes to establish sexual dimorphism in plasma lipid levels.",experiment,,x,,,plasma lipid levels,dyslipidemia,,,,,,We demonstrate that having 2 X chromosomes versus an X and Y chromosome complement drives sex differences in HDL-C.

Our study examined associations of sex and age with MAOA first exon and intron methylation levels in 252 women and 157 men aged 14-73 years. Participants included adolescents recruited at a substance misuse clinic, their siblings and parents, and healthy women. Women showed similar to 50% higher levels of exonic, and similar to 15% higher intronic, methylation than men. Methylation levels were similar between younger (M = 22.7 years) and older (M = 46.1 years) participants, and stable across age. Age modified few associations of methylation levels with sex. MAOA genotypes modified few associations of methylation with sex and age. Higher methylation levels among women were not explained by genotype, nor interaction of genotype and sexual abuse. Findings were similar after adjusting for lifetime diagnoses of substance dependence (women = 24.3%; men = 34.2%). Methylation levels were higher among women who experienced sexual abuse than women who did not.

V. and Nakayama, T. and Engebrecht, J.","During meiosis in the heterogametic sex in some species, sex chromosomes undergo meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), which results in acquisition of repressive chromatin and transcriptional silencing. In Caenorhabditis elegans, MSCI is mediated by MET-2 methyltransferase deposition of histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation. Here we examined the meiotic chromatin landscape in germ lines of four Caenorhabditis species; C. remanei and C. brenneri represent ancestral gonochorism, while C. briggsae and C. elegans are two lineages that independently evolved hermaphroditism. While MSCI is conserved across all four species, repressive chromatin modifications are distinct and do not correlate with reproductive mode. In contrast to C. elegans and C. remanei germ cells where X chromosomes are enriched for histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation, X chromosomes in C. briggsae and C. brenneri germ cells are enriched for histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation. Inactivation of C. briggsae MET-2 resulted in germ-line X chromosome transcription and checkpoint activation. Further, both histone H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation were reduced in Cbr-met-2 mutant germ lines, suggesting that in contrast to C. elegans, H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation are interdependent. C. briggsae H3 lysine 9 trimethylation was redistributed in the presence of asynapsed chromosomes in a sex-specific manner in the related process of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin. However, these repressive marks did not influence X chromosome replication timing.

To help identify new mutations of the X-linked SCID gene and to provide genetic counseling, X chromosome inactivation patterns in T cells from 16 women who had sons with sporadic SCID were examined. Between 9 and 35 human/hamster hybrids that selectively retained the active human X chromosome were produced from the T cells of each woman and analyzed with an X-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism for which the woman in question was heterozygous. Exclusive use of a single X as the active X was seen in the T cell hybrids from 7 of the 16 women, identifying these women as carriers of X-linked SCID. Studies on additional family members confirmed the mutant nature of the inactive X and revealed the source of the new mutation in three families. To determine whether there were any laboratory characteristics that might differentiate the boys whose mothers were identified as carriers of X-linked SCID from those whose mothers were not, the clinical records of both groups were compared to each other and to a group of 14 boys with a family history of X-linked SCID.

We analyzed DNA methylation changes during reprogramming of male and female somatic cells and in resulting induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). At an intermediate reprogramming stage, somatic and pluripotency enhancers are targeted for partial methylation and demethylation. Demethylation within pluripotency enhancers often occurs at ESC binding sites of pluripotency transcription factors. Late in reprogramming, global hypomethylation is induced in a female-specific manner. Genome-wide hypomethylation in female cells affects many genomic landmarks, including enhancers and imprint control regions, and accompanies the reactivation of the inactive X chromosome. The loss of one of the two X chromosomes in propagating female iPSCs is associated with genome-wide methylation gain. Collectively, our findings highlight the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation at enhancers during reprogramming and reveal that X chromosome dosage dictates global DNA methylation levels in iPSCs. Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to iPSCs, inducing reactivation of the inactive X chromosome. Using genome-scale DNA methylation analyses, Plath, Pasque, and colleagues show that iPSCs adopt sex-specific differences in global DNA methylation that correlate with the presence of two active X chromosomes. Upon culture, female iPSCs lose one of the two X chromosomes and adopt male-like DNA methylation.",experiment,,,,x,"cell development, XCI",,"DNA methylation, hypomethylation",,,,,

Meiotic X-inactivation and sexual antagonism can only partly account for these patterns. Here, we show that dosage compensation (DC) in Drosophila may contribute substantially to the depletion of male genes on the X. To equalize expression between X-linked and autosomal genes in the two sexes, male Drosophila hypertranscribe their single X, whereas female mammals silence one of their two X chromosomes. We combine fine-scale mapping data of dosage compensated regions with genome-wide expression profiles and show that most male-biased genes on the D. melanogaster X are located outside dosage compensated regions. Additionally, X-linked genes that have newly acquired male-biased expression in D. melanogaster are less likely to be dosage compensated, and parental X-linked genes that gave rise to an autosomal male-biased retrocopy are more likely located within compensated regions. This suggests that DC contributes to the observed demasculinization of X chromosomes in Drosophila, both by limiting the emergence of male-biased expression patterns of existing X genes, and by contributing to gene trafficking of male genes off the X.",experiment,,,x,,,,drosophila,,,,x,

J. and Livingston, D. H.","Females have a longer lifespan and better general health than males. Considerable number of studies also demonstrated that, after trauma and sepsis, females present better outcomes as compared to males indicating sex-related differences in the innate immune response. The current notion is that differences in the immuno-modulatory effects of sex hormones are the underlying causative mechanism. However, the field remains controversial and the exclusive role of sex hormones has been challenged. Here, we propose that polymorphic X-linked immune competent genes, which are abundant in the population are important players in sex-based immuno-modulation and play a key role in causing sex-related outcome differences following trauma or sepsis. We describe the differences in X chromosome (ChrX) regulation between males and females and its consequences in the context of common X-linked polymorphisms at the individual as well as population level. We also discuss the potential pathophysiological and immune-modulatory aspects of ChrX cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females and how this may contribute to sex-biased immune-modulation. The potential confounding effects of ChrX skewing of cell progenitors at the bone marrow is also presented together with aspects of acute trauma-induced de novo ChrX skewing at the periphery. In support of the hypothesis, novel observations indicating ChrX skewing in a female trauma cohort as well as case studies depicting the temporal relationship between trauma-induced cellular skewing and the clinical course are also described. Finally, we list and discuss a selected set of polymorphic X-linked genes, which are frequent in the population and have key regulatory or metabolic functions in the innate immune response and, therefore, are primary candidates for mediating sex-biased immune responses. We conclude that sex-related differences in a variety of disease processes including the innate inflammatory response to injury and infection may be related to the abundance of X-linked polymorphic immune-competent genes, differences in ChrX regulation, and inheritance patterns between the sexes and the presence of X-linked cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females.",experiment,Xist,,,,X chromosome mosaicism,autoimmune ,,,,,,relevant. could give genes of interest for autimmune disease

However, the general mechanisms of folding the genome into TADs are not fully understood. Here we test the effects of deleting a CTCF-rich locus on TAD boundary formation. Using genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), we focus on one TAD boundary on chromosome X harboring ~ 15 CTCF binding sites and located at the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) locus Firre. Specifically, this TAD boundary is invariant across evolution, tissues, and temporal dynamics of X-chromosome inactivation. We demonstrate that neither the deletion of this locus nor the ectopic insertion of Firre cDNA or its ectopic expression are sufficient to alter TADs in a sex-specific or allele-specific manner. In contrast, Firre's deletion disrupts the chromatin super-loop formation of the inactive X-chromosome.

We found that female human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) display reduced X-linked gene expression before entering meiosis. Moreover, in hPGCs, both X chromosomes are active and express the long non-coding RNAs X active coating transcript (XACT) and X inactive specific transcript (XIST)—the master regulator of XCI—which are silenced after entry into meiosis. We find that XACT is a hPGC marker, describe XCD associated with XIST expression in hPGCs and suggest that XCD evolved in humans to regulate X-linked genes in pre-implantation embryos and PGCs.

Combined analysis of single embryo RNA-seq data and parental genome sequencing was used to evaluate parental contributions to early development and investigate X-chromosome dynamics. In addition, we evaluated dimorphism in gene expression between male and female embryos. Evaluation of parent-specific gene expression revealed a minor increase in paternal expression at the 4-cell stage that increased at the 8-cell stage. We also detected eight genes with allelic expression bias that may have an important role in early development, notably NANOGNB. The main actor in X-chromosome inactivation, XIST, was significantly upregulated at the 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages in female embryos, with high expression at the latter. Sexual dimorphism in gene expression was identified at all stages, with strong representation of the X-chromosome in females from the 16-cell to the blastocyst stage. Female embryos showed biparental X-chromosome expression at all stages after the 4-cell stage, demonstrating the absence of imprinted X-inactivation at the embryo level. The analysis of gene dosage showed incomplete dosage compensation (0.5 < X:A < 1) in MII oocytes and embryos up to the 4-cell stage, an increase of the X:A ratio at the 16-cell and morula stages after genome activation, and a decrease of the X:A ratio at the blastocyst stage, which might be associated with the beginning of X-chromosome inactivation.

As part of this question we asked whether mouse X-Y homologous gene pairs are expressed in brain in a sex-specific fashion. Using RT-PCR and northern blot analysis, we assessed mRNA expression in brain of eight Y-linked genes as well as their X-linked homologues, at three ages: 13.5 days post coitum, the day of birth (P1) and adult. Transcripts of six Y genes were expressed at one or more ages: Usp9y, Ube1y, Smcy, Eif2s3y, Uty and Dby. Their expression also occurred in XY female brain, and therefore does not require testicular secretions. Six X-linked homologues (Usp9x, Ube1x, Smcx, Eif2s3x, Utx and Dbx) were also expressed in brain, and in adulthood all of these transcripts were expressed at significantly higher levels in brains of females than in brains of males, irrespective of their X-inactivation status. For five of these gene pairs, the expression of the Y-linked homologue in males was not sufficient to compensate for the female bias in X gene expression. Three X-Y gene pairs, Usp9x/y, Ube1x/y and Eif2s3x/y, appeared to be differentially regulated (expressed in brain in a different age- or tissue-dependent pattern), and hence may not be functionally equivalent.

We found no difference in degree of skewing between patients (median 64%) and controls (median 65%) (P = 0.474). The X-inactivation pattern did thus not explain the female predominance of MS patients in general.

Such genes are therefore potentially subject to sex-specific imbalance between males and females. Aside from XIST, the non-coding RNA on the X chromosome destined to be inactivated, very little is known about the extent of loci that may be selectively silenced on the active X chromosome (Xa). Using longitudinal array-based DNA methylation profiling of two human tissues, we have identified specific and widespread active X-specific DNA methylation showing stability over time and across tissues of disparate origin.

Immunofluorescence studies showed that soon after Xist RNA coating the inactive X (Xi) undergoes many heterochromatic changes, including the acquisition of H3K27me3. However, the mechanisms that lead to the establishment of heterochromatin remain unclear. We first analyze chromatin changes by ChIP-chip, as well as RNA expression, around the X-inactivation center (Xic) in female and male ES cells, and their day 4 and 10 differentiated derivatives. A dynamic epigenetic landscape is observed within the Xic locus. Tsix repression is accompanied by deposition of H3K27me3 at its promoter during differentiation of both female and male cells. However, only in female cells does an active epigenetic landscape emerge at the Xist locus, concomitant with high Xist expression. Several regions within and around the Xic show unsuspected chromatin changes, and we define a series of unusual loci containing highly enriched H3K27me3. Genomewide ChIP-seq analyses show a female-specific quantitative increase of H3K27me3 across the X chromosome as XCI proceeds in differentiating female ES cells. Using female ES cells with nonrandom XCI and polymorphic X chromosomes, we demonstrate that this increase is specific to the Xi by allele-specific SNP mapping of the ChIP-seq tags. H3K27me3 becomes evenly associated with the Xi in a chromosome-wide fashion. A selective and robust increase of H3K27me3 and concomitant decrease in H3K4me3 is observed over active genes.

Here, we used an in vitro differentiation model to convert human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into trophoblastic progenitor cells of the first-trimester placenta, which will eventually become mature extravillous trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. We observed significant sex differences in transcriptomic profiles of hESCs and trophoblastic progenitors, and also with the differentiation process itself. Male cells had higher dosage of X/Y gene pairs relative to female samples, supporting functions for Y-linked genes beyond spermatogenesis in the hESCs and in the early placenta. Female-specific differentiation altered the expression of several thousand genes compared with male cells, and female cells specifically upregulated numerous autosomal genes with known roles in trophoblast function. Sex-biased upregulation of cellular pathways during trophoblast differentiation was also evident.

We previously studied two female patients with HSD10 deficiency, one of them was severely affected and the other presented a mild phenotype. To elucidate as to why these two carriers were so differently affected, cDNA analyses were performed. The HSD17B10 cDNA of eight control cell lines, two hemizygous patients and two carriers was obtained from cultured fibroblasts, amplified by PCR and sequenced by standard methods. All HSD17B10 cDNAs were quantified by real-time PCR. In the fibroblasts of the female patient who presented with the severe phenotype, only the mutant allele was identified in the cDNA sequence, which was further confirmed by relative quantification (RQ) of HSD17B10 cDNA. This is in agreement with an unfavourable X-inactivation. The other female patient, with slight clinical affectation, showed the presence of both mutant and wild-type alleles in the cDNA sequence, which was confirmed by RQ of HSD17B10 cDNA in fibroblasts.

However, the underlying relationship and mechanisms among these processes remain unclear. Here, we systematically dissected these features along developmental progression using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and single-cell RNA sequencing with allelic resolution. We found that mESCs grown in a ground state 2i condition displayed transcriptomic profiles diffused from preimplantation mouse embryonic cells, whereas EpiStem cells closely resembled the post-implantation epiblast. Sex-related gene expression varied greatly across distinct developmental states. We also identified novel markers that were highly enriched in each developmental state. Moreover, we revealed that several novel pathways, including PluriNetWork and Focal Adhesion, were responsible for the delayed progression of female EpiStem cells. Importantly, we ""digitalized"" XCI progression using allelic expression of active and inactive X Chromosomes and surprisingly found that XCI states exhibited profound variability in each developmental state, including the 2i condition. XCI progression was not tightly synchronized with loss of pluripotency and increase of differentiation at the single-cell level, although these processes were globally correlated. In addition, highly expressed genes, including core pluripotency factors, were in general biallelically expressed. Taken together, our study sheds light on the dynamics of XCI progression and the asynchronicity between pluripotency, differentiation, and XCI.",experiment,,,,,cell development,,,,,,x,

We were interested in the level of NTD to correlate variables with primary neurulation versus secondary neurulation (canalisation) defects. 299 (57%) of our cases were primary neurulation defects (ie, had cranial or vertebral defects above T12) and 230 (43%) were secondary neurulation or canalisation defects (ie, had no recognisable vertebral defect above L1). The cases were also distinguished by presence or absence of additional congenital anomalies. 20% of the primary neurulation defects had additional congenital anomalies, while there was no increase in congenital anomalies among the canalisation defect group. The M/F sex ratio for all isolated NTDs (ie, without additional anomalies), including both neurulation and canalisation defects, was 0.83, while that of all NTDs with additional anomalies was 1.2. The sex ratio for isolated cases of all primary neurulation defects was 0.65. The sex ratio for all other categories of NTDs (except the very small group of multiple neural tube defects with anomalies) was greater than or close to 1.0 or had been skewed away from 1.0 by having isolated primary NTDs within the category. Thus our data resemble those of Martinez Frias et al. We did not find the excess of females only in the group of NTDs with abnormal thoracic and cervical vertebrae which Seller observed in her pathological specimens; in our clinic population there was an excess of females among isolated primary neurulation defects of all types. This difference may be related to the fact that most of our cases were term deliveries or liveborn rather than terminations. Seller and James have suggested that female embryos develop more slowly than males, making them susceptible to failure of proper neural tube formation. We would like to suggest that some component of the slower early embryological development seen in females may be secondary to delayed X inactivation, of some or all of an X chromosome in some or all of the cells of the female embryos with NTDs. Late inactivation would make those cells in the developing embryo aneuploid with regard to the X chromosome by virtue of having two active X chromosomes. A variety of human aneuploidies predispose to NTDs. Aneuploid cells would be expected to divide more slowly than normal (eg, more slowly than male cells or female cells which have completed normal inactivation of one X). A slower rate of cell division and tissue growth would be expected to predispose to failure of neural tube closure (primary neurulation). This hypothesis should be testable in mice with appropriate X chromosome markers to demonstrate X inactivation or lack thereof in early embryo development.",experiment,,,,,cell development,"neurological, neural tube defects (NTD)",,,,,,

H.","In the somatic cells of female mammals, either the maternally or paternally derived X chromosome (X(M) or X(P)) is randomly inactivated to achieve dosage compensation for X-linked genes. In early mouse development, however, selective inactivation of X(P) occurs first in extraembryonic lineages at the blastocyst stage around the time of implantation before later random inactivation in the embryonic ectoderm from which the fetus is derived. Xist, a gene mapping to the X-inactivation centre (Xic), is exclusively expressed from the inactive X-chromosome and is thought to be involved in the initiation of X-inactivation. Consistent with this, Xist is first expressed at the 4-to 8-cell stages, prior to functional inactivation at the blastocyst stage, exclusively from X(P) in female embryos. This also suggests that genomic imprinting may influence the earliest expression of Xist resulting in selective inactivation of X(P) and a candidate methylation site in the promoter region has recently been described. Here we report the expression of the human homologue, XIST, in human preimplantation embryos from the 5- to 10-cell stage onwards consistent with its role in the initiation of inactivation. In contrast to the mouse, however, transcripts were detected in both male and female embryos demonstrating XIST expression from the X(M) in male embryos (X(M)Y).",experiment,Xist,,,x,XCI,,,,,x,,

Women and men differ in three major biological points: the number of X chromosomes per cell, the type and quantities of sex hormones present and the ability to be pregnant, all of which have immunological consequences. Could a greater understanding of these differences lead to a new era of personalized sex-specific medicine? This Review focuses on the main genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that have been put forward to explain sex bias in rheumatic diseases, including X chromosome inactivation, sex chromosome aneuploidy and microchimerism.

The X chromosome plays an important role in human disease and traits of many species, especially those with sexually dimorphic characteristics. Special attention needs to be given to its analysis due to the unique inheritance pattern, which leads to analytical complications that have resulted in the majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) either not considering X or mishandling it with toolsets that had been designed for non-sex chromosomes. We hence developed XWAS to fill the need for tools that are specially designed for analysis of X. Following extensive, stringent, and X-specific quality control, XWAS offers an array of statistical tests of association, including: 1) the standard test between a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and disease risk, including after first stratifying individuals by sex, 2) a test for a differential effect of a SNP on disease between males and females, 3) motivated by X-inactivation, a test for higher variance of a trait in heterozygous females as compared with homozygous females, and 4) for all tests, a version that allows for combining evidence from all SNPs across a gene. We applied the toolset analysis pipeline to 16 GWAS datasets of immune-related disorders and 7 risk factors of coronary artery disease, and discovered several new X-linked genetic associations.

Most of these tests are designed for testing of associations between a phenotype and an autosomal genotype and are therefore not applicable to X chromosome data. Testing for association on the X chromosome raises unique challenges that have motivated the development of X-specific statistical tests in the literature. However, to date there has been no study of these methods under a wide range of realistic study designs, allele frequencies and disease models to assess the size and power of each test. To address this, we have performed an extensive simulation study to investigate the effects of the sex ratios in the case and control cohorts, as well as the allele frequencies, on the size and power of eight test statistics under three different disease models that each account for X-inactivation. We show that existing, but under-used, methods that make use of both male and female data are uniformly more powerful than popular methods that make use of only female data. In particular, we show that Clayton's one degree of freedom statistic [Clayton, 2008] is robust and powerful across a wide range of realistic simulation parameters. Our results provide guidance on selecting the most appropriate test statistic to analyse X chromosome data from GWAS and show that much power can be gained by a more careful analysis of X chromosome GWAS data.",tool,,x,,,XCI,,,GWAS,,,,

Definitions and classifications of autoimmune diseases differ, as do the F/M ratios themselves. The sex ratio of lupus is the single most prominent, little explored clinical fact that may lead to understanding of how lupus and other autoimmune diseases occur. The objective of this study was to evaluate evidence for causes of high F/M ratios of autoimmune and non-immunologic diseases. This was done by a literature review. Some thyroid, rheumatic and hepatic diseases consistently have high F/M ratios; other autoimmune diseases have low ratios. Because F/M ratios reflect disease incidence, not disease severity, an intrinsic biologic cause for the F/M ratios (such as estrogen) would be likely to act through a threshold or permissive mechanism rather than through quantitative immunomodulation. Sex differences related to environmental exposure, X-inactivation, imprinting, X or Y chromosome genes and intrauterine influences are other possible explanations for sex differences of incidence.

Embryos were produced in vitro using X-or Y-sorted semen and treated at Day 5 of culture with 10 ng/mL bovine CSF2 or control. In experiment 1, morulae were collected at Day 6 and biological replicates (n = 8) were evaluated for transcript abundance of 90 genes by RT-qPCR using the Fluidigm Delta Gene assay. Expression of more than one-third (33 of 90) of genes examined was affected by sex. The effect of CSF2 on gene expression was modified by sex (P < 0.05) for five genes (DDX3Y/DDX3X-like, NANOG, MYF6, POU5F1 and RIPK3) and tended (P < 0.10) to be modified by sex for five other genes (DAPK1, HOXA5, PPP2R3A, PTEN and TNFSF8). In experiment 2, embryos were treated at Day 5 with control or CSF2 and blastocysts were collected at Day 7 for immunolabeling to determine the number of inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) cells. CSF2 increased the percent of putative zygotes that became blastocysts for females, but did not affect the development of males. There was no effect of CSF2 or interaction of CSF2 with sex on the total number of blastomeres in blastocysts or in the number of inner cell mass or trophectoderm cells.

Here we show that mouse spermatogenesis genes are relatively under-represented on the X chromosome and female-biased genes are enriched on it. We used Spo11 -/- mice blocked in spermatogenesis early in meiosis to evaluate the temporal pattern of gene expression in sperm development.

Similar to genetic association studies of main effects, this approach to discover potentially interacting SNPs has so far been restricted to autosomes. Extension to X-chromosomal SNPs faces several analytical challenges including dosage compensation via X-inactivation and allelic heterogeneity. Focusing on Levene's test to detect phenotypic variance differences associated with the genotype groups of an X-chromosome SNP, we first note that sex can be an inherent confounder; sex necessarily correlates with the number of minor allele of the SNP, and it could also correlate, through both mean and variance, with the distribution of quantitative traits that exhibit sexual dimorphism, such as height and BMI. We then show theoretically that the na√Øve 3-group analytical strategy combining the genotypes of females and males could lead to spurious variance signals through confounding. We also provide results from extensive simulation and application studies to show that 1) the extent of confounding depends on the discrepancy between the two sex-stratified trait distributions, 2) a 5-group analytical approach accounting for the inherent sex-specific mean and variance effects is the most robust, and 3) there is much need for novel broad-sense her-itability estimation methods that incorporate X-chromosome loci.",tool,,,,x,GAWS studies,,,"Levene's test, GAWS",,x,,

Men and women respond similarly to infection and vaccination, which suggests that the intrinsic differences in immune response between the sexes do not account for differences in disease frequency. In autoimmune-like illnesses caused by recognized environmental agents, sex discrepancy is usually explained by differences in exposure. Because the beginnings of autoimmune diseases can be identified decades before clinical illness, a causative factor also would have to be sought decades before illness. Endogenous hormones are not a likely explanation for sex discrepancy; hormones could have an effect if the effect is a threshold rather than quantitative.

However, inclusion of female animals and women often does not mean that information regarding potential hormonal interactions with pharmacological treatments or clinical outcomes is available. All sex steroid hormones can interact with receptors for drug targets, metabolism and transport. Genetic variation in receptors or in enzymatic function might contribute to sex differences in therapeutic efficacy and adverse drug reactions.

R.","Context: Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) exhibits significant sexual dimorphism in the incidence, etiology, and response to intravesical immunotherapy. Environmental factors such as tobacco use and clinical management issues such as delayed presentation have widely been associated with sex differences in UCB outcomes. Emerging findings from immune checkpoint blockade trials are suggestive of differential outcomes in females compared with males. Sex-specific differences in the way immune system functions and responds to pathogenic insults are well established. As such, an in-depth understanding of the genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to sex-associated differences in response to immunomodulatory therapies is needed urgently for improved management of UCB. Objective: To review the associations between patient sex and clinical outcomes, with a focus on the incidence, host intrinsic features, and response to therapies in UCB. Evidence acquisition: Using the PubMed database, this narrative review evaluates published findings from mouse model-based and clinical cohort studies to identify factors associated with sex and clinical outcomes in bladder cancer. A scoping review of the key findings on epidemiology, genetic, hormonal, immune physiology, and clinical outcomes was performed to explore potential factors that could have implications in immunomodulatory therapy design. Evidence synthesis: Sex-associated differences in UCB incidence and clinical outcomes are influenced by sex hormones, local bladder resident immune populations, tumor genetics, and bladder microbiome. In the context of therapeutic outcomes, sex differences are prominent in response to bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin immunotherapy used in the treatment of non‚Äìmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. Similarly, with respect to tumor molecular profiles in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, tumors from females show enrichment of the basal subtype. Conclusions: Among proposed tumor/host intrinsic factors that may influence response to immune-based therapies, patient sex remains a challenging consideration that deserves further attention. Evidence to date supports a multifactorial origin of sexual dimorphism in the incidence and outcomes of UCB. Patient summary: In this review, we highlight the sex-associated host and tumor intrinsic features that may potentially drive differential disease progression and therapeutic response in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Sexual dimorphism in bladder cancer incidence and clinical outcomes is well established. Significant differences in sex-associated physiological immune responses play critical roles in response to conventional and novel immunotherapy for bladder cancer. ",review,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the onset of XCI, Xist RNA accumulates on one of two Xs, coating and silencing the chromosome in cis. The molecular basis for monoallelic Xist upregulation is not known, though evidence predominantly supports a posttranscriptional mechanism through RNA stabilization. Here, we test whether Tsix RNA destabilizes Xist RNA. Unexpectedly, we find that Xist upregulation is not based on transcript stabilization at all but is instead controlled by transcription in a sex-specific manner. Tsix directly regulates its transcription. On the future inactive X, Tsix downregulation induces a transient heterochromatic state in Xist, followed paradoxically by high-level Xist expression. A Tsix-deficient X chromosome adopts the heterochromatic state in pre-XCI cells. This state persists through XCI establishment and ""reverts"" to a euchromatic state during XCI maintenance. We have therefore identified chromatin marks that preempt and predict asymmetric Xist expression. ¬©2006 Elsevier Inc.",experiment,"Xist, Tsix",,,,"XCI, upregulation of Xist",,,,,x,,

The buffering effect of heterozygosity in females will be partly constrained by the skewing of X-inactivation patterns increasing the variance of females beyond what is expected. Furthermore, escape of some X-linked genes from in-activation may also be relevant to male-female variance comparisons. We also comment on the difficulty of establishing the extent to which the X chromosome is enriched for intelligence genes and point out that their estimates of the proportion of genes influencing general intelligence that might be located on the X chromosome rely on some doubtful premises, especially concerning the likely equivalence of X-linked gene action in males and females. Finally, we discuss the increasingly compelling evidence for the accumulation of genes on the X chromosome that have selective benefit to males, including those implicated infertility and some manifestations of intelligence.",review,,,,,,intelligence,,,,x,,

Whether this X-linked condition could be detected in the adult or also could affect women is unknown. A large five-generation family was identified in which the recently described arginine-vasopressin receptor type 2 (AVPR2) mutation that is responsible for NSIAD was segregated. The proband was a 74-yr-old patient who had a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and whose hyponatremia resisted administration of two AVPR2 antagonists. The phenotype of family members who carry the mutation was investigated. Patients with normal serum sodium were subjected to a water-load test. The previously reported activating missense R137C mutation in the AVPR2 gene in three hemizygous male and four heterozygous female individuals was identified. Except in one woman, spontaneous episodes of hyponatremia or abnormal water-load test were identified in all patients with the mutation, whether male or female. Skewed X inactivation was evidenced in the blood of the asymptomatic woman, which is compatible with preferential inactivation of her mutated allele. NSIAD is not limited to male infants.

326,The X-files of inflammation: Cellular mosaicism of X-linked polymorphic genes and the female advantage in the host response to injury and infection,2007,Shock,"Spolarics, Z.","Females as compared with males display better general health status, longevity, and improved clinical course after injury and infection. It is generally believed that the female advantage is associated with the effects of sex hormones. This review argues that the sex benefit of females during the host response is associated with polymorphism of X-linked genes and cellular mosaicism for X-linked parental alleles. Cells from females carry both parental X chromosomes (maternal, Xm; or paternal, Xp), whereas males carry only one (Xm). Because of dosage compensation and random X inactivation, half of the cells from females express either Xm or Xp. Therefore, females are cellular mosaics for their X-linked polymorphic genes. This cellular mosaicism in females represents a more adaptive and balanced cellular machinery that is advantageous during the innate immune response. Several genes encoding key metabolic and regulatory proteins reside on the X chromosome, including members of the apoptotic cascade, hormone homeostasis, glucose metabolic enzymes, superoxide-producing machinery, and the toll-like receptor/nuclear factor Œ∫B/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway. Polymorphic forms of these X-linked proteins are likely to manifest in phenotypic differences in the mosaic cell populations in females and may contribute to sex-related differences in the host response to injury and infection. The unique inheritance pattern of X-linked polymorphisms and their potential confounding effects in clinical trials are also discussed; furthermore, we present potential biomarkers for studying mosaic cell populations of innate immunity. ¬©2007The Shock Society.",review,Xist ,mosaicism,,,mosaicism,autoimmune,,,,,,

Counting is regulated by the X-inactivation centre, which contains the Xist gene. Deleting 65 kb 3‚Ä≤ to Xist in XO embryonic stem (ES) cells affects counting and results in inappropriate XCI upon differentiation. We show here that normal counting can be rescued in these deleted ES cells using cre/loxP re-insertion, and refine the location of elements controlling counting within a 20 kb bipartite domain. Furthermore, we show that the 65 kb deletion also leads to inappropriate XCI in XY differentiated ES cells, which excludes the involvement of sex-specific mechanisms in the initiation of XCI. At the chromatin level, we have found that the Xist gene corresponds to a peak of H3 Lys-4 dimethylation, which is dramatically and specifically affected by the deletion 3‚Ä≤ to Xist.

P. and Bornholdt, D. and Engel, H. and Grzeschik, K. H.","The CHILD syndrome (MIM 308050), an acronym for congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects, is an X-linked dominant trait with lethality for male embryos. Recently, we elucidated the underlying gene defect by demonstrating point mutations in NSDHL (NAD[P]H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein) at Xq28 in 6 patients with classic CHILD syndrome. The most striking clinical feature is an inflammatory nevus that usually shows a unique lateralization with strict midline demarcation. Ipsilateral defects involve all skeletal structures and internal organs such as the brain, the lung, the heart, or the kidney. As an exception to this rule, in some cases the CHILD nevus may occur in a more or less bilateral distribution. In 1997 Fink-Puches et al described a case of CHILD nevus with an almost symmetric arrangement. To test the correctness of the diagnosis, we now examined blood lymphocytes of this patient by single-strand conformation analysis and genomic sequencing. We identified a novel missense mutation in NSDHL that potentially may impair protein function. We conclude that a diagnosis of CHILD syndrome can be based on clinical features such as the highly characteristic morphology of the CHILD nevus. A symmetric distribution of this nevus can exceptionally be seen in patients with CHILD syndrome, and this bilateral involvement should not mislead the clinician to any other diagnosis. Apparently, the effect of random X-inactivation is responsible for different patterns of cutaneous involvement in female carriers of NSDHL mutations.",experiment,NSDHL,,,,mosaicism,congenital hemidysplasia,,,,x,,

This paper proposes 1 and 2 degree-of-freedom tests for association which do not assume Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and which treat males as homozygous females.

330,A chicken transferrin gene in transgenic mice escapes X-chromosome inactivation,1987,Science,"Goldman, M. A. and Stokes, K. R. and Idzerda, R. L.","Mammalian X-chromosome inactivation involves a coordinate shutting down of physically linked genes. Several proposed models require the presence of specific sequences near genes to permit the spread of inactivation into these regions. If such models are correct, one might predict that heterologous genes transferred onto the X chromosome might lack the appropriate signal sequences and therefore escape inactivation. To determine whether a foreign gene inserted into the X chromosome is subject to inactivation, transgenic mice harboring 11 copies of the complete, 17-kilobase chicken transferrin gene on the X chromosome were used. Male mice hemizygous for this insert were bred with females bearing Searle's translocation, an X-chromosome rearrangement that is always active in heterozygous females (the unrearranged X chromosome is inactive). Female offspring bearing the Searle's translocation and the chicken transferrin gene had the same amount of chicken transferrin messenger RNA in liver as did transgenic male mice or transgenic female mice lacking the Searle's chromosome. This result shows that the inserted gene is not subject to X-chromosome inactivation and suggests that the inactivation process cannot spread over 187 kilobases of DNA in the absence of specific signal sequences required for inactivation.",experiment,foreign gene inserted,,mammals,,XCI,,,mice,,,,"""This result shows that the inserted gene is not subject to X-chromosome inactivation and suggests that the inactivation process cannot spread over 187 kilobases of DNA in the absence of specific signal sequences required for inactivation."" possible implication into humans and disease.

The behavioral genetics literature has long pointed to the link between postsynaptic protein complexes coded on chromosome X and mental retardation. More recently, novel genomic evidence has emerged of X-linked mRNA overexpression of neuronal source in the human brain. We review the evidence for this hypothesis and its consistency with the distribution across genders of brain disorders of known aetiology. We then provide examples of the utilization of this hypothesis in the investigation of the pathophysiology of complex brain disorders in both the stratification of disease cohorts and the development of realistic preclinical models.

In this review, we describe the advantages and limitations of genetic methodologies, and how these methods have been used to discover candidate genes in smaller populations of pediatric patients. We also introduce novel concepts for nontraditional modes of genetic inheritance that may be important in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Recent findings Candidate genes identified by linkage analyses and genome-wide association scans in adult populations have led to focused genetic studies in pediatric populations. Some genes are associated with subsets of both adult and pediatric patients; others appear to be age specific. Novel concepts in genetics have uncovered potential contributions of maternal compared with paternal transmission, noninherited maternal alleles that may work through maternal microchimerism, and sex-specific epigenetic mechanisms of immunoregulation. Summary Advancing methods are leading to the discovery of genes associated with childhood autoimmune diseases. However, the genetic contribution to disease risk for any one gene remains less than 30% for most diseases, suggesting that pediatric autoimmunity is not primarily genetic in a classical sense. A combinatorial approach considering the contributions of multiple genes, mode of inheritance, and environmental influences will be required to fully understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis in pediatric autoimmune disease.",review,,,,,genetic methodologies,autoimmune,,genetic methodologies,age,,,

Here we show that sex differences in polyamine metabolism are associated with escape from X chromosome inactivation of the gene encoding spermine synthase (SMS). Female placental trophoblasts demonstrate biallelic SMS expression, associated with increased SMS mRNA and enzyme activity. Polyamine depletion in primary trophoblasts reduced glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation resulting in decreased acetyl-coA availability and global histone hypoacetylation in a sex-dependent manner. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-sequencing identifies progesterone biosynthesis as a target of polyamine regulated gene expression, and polyamine depletion reduced progesterone release in male trophoblasts. The effects of polyamine depletion can be attributed to spermine as SMS-silencing recapitulated the effects on energy metabolism, histone acetylation, and progesterone release. In summary, spermine metabolism alters trophoblast gene expression through acetyl-coA biosynthesis and histone acetylation, and SMS escape from X inactivation explains some features of human placental sex differences.",,SMS,polyamine metabolism,,,"polyamine metabolism, EXCI",placental dysfunction,acetyl-coA biosynthesis and histone acetylation,,,x,,

A.","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a sex-biased disease with a poorly understood female prevalence. Emerging research suggests that nonhormonal factors, such as the XX or XY sex chromosome complement and sex bias in gene expression, may also lead to sex-based differences in PAH incidence, penetrance, and progression. Typically, one of females' two X chromosomes is epigenetically silenced to offer a gender-balanced gene expression. Recent data demonstrate that the long noncoding RNA X-inactive specific transcript, essential for X chromosome inactivation and dosage compensation of X-linked gene expression, shows elevated levels in female PAH lung specimens compared with controls. This molecular event leads to incomplete inactivation of the females' second X chromosome, abnormal expression of X-linked gene(s) involved in PAH pathophysiology, and a pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) proliferative phenotype. Moreover, the pathogenic proliferative p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/ETS transcription factor ELK1 (Elk1)/cFos signaling is mechanistically linked to the sexually dimorphic proliferative response of PAECs in PAH. Apprehending the complicated relationship between long noncoding RNA X-inactive specific transcript and X-linked genes and how this relationship integrates into a sexually dimorphic proliferation of PAECs and PAH sex paradox remain challenging. We highlight herein new findings related to how the sex chromosome complement and sex-differentiated epigenetic mechanisms to control gene expression are decisive players in the sexual dimorphism of PAH.

H.","Background:CXorf21 and SLC15a4 both contain risk alleles for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS). The former escapes X inactivation. Our group predicts specific endolysosomal-dependent immune responses are driven by the protein products of these genes, which form a complex at the endolysosomal surface. Our previous studies have shown that knocking out CXorf21 increases lysosomal pH in female monocytes, and the present study assesses whether the lysosomal pH in 46,XX women, who overexpress CXorf21 in monocytes, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs), differs from 46,XY men. Methods: To determine endolysosome compartment pH we used both LysoSensor‚Ñ¢ Yellow/Blue DND-160 and pHrodo¬Æ Red AM Intracellular pH Indicator in primary monocyte, B cells, DCs, NK cells, and T cells from healthy men and women volunteers. Results: Compared to male samples, female monocytes, B cells, and DCs had lower endolysosomal pH (female/male pH value: monocytes 4.9/5.6 p < 0.0001; DCs 4.9/5.7 p = 0.044; B cells 5.0/5.6 p < 0.05). Interestingly, T cells and NK cells, which both express low levels of CXorf21, showed no differential pH levels between men and women. Conclusion: We have previously shown that subjects with two or more X-chromosomes have increased CXorf21 expression in specific primary immune cells. Moreover, knockdown of CXorf21 increases lysosomal pH in female monocytes. The present data show that female monocytes, DC, B cells, where CXorf21 is robustly expressed, have lower lysosomal pH compared to the same immune cell populations from males. The lower pH levels observed in specific female immune cells provide a function to these SLE/SS-associated genes and a mechanism for the reported inflated endolysosomal-dependent immune response observed in women compared to men (i.e., TLR7/type I Interferon activity).",experiment,"CXorf21, SLC15a4",,,,lysosomal pH,systemic lupus erythematosus,,"monocyte, B cells, DCs, NK cells, and T cells from healthy men and women",,,,

J.","Interest in analyzing X chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is growing and several approaches have been proposed. Prior studies have compared power of different approaches, but bias and interpretation of coefficients have received less attention. We performed simulations to demonstrate the impact of X chromosome model assumptions on effect estimates. We investigated the coefficient biases of SNP and sex effects with commonly used models for X chromosome SNPs, including models with and without assumptions of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), and with and without SNP-sex interaction terms. Sex and SNP coefficient biases were observed when assumptions made about XCI and sex differences in SNP effect in the analysis model were inconsistent with the data-generating model. However, including a SNP-sex interaction term often eliminated these biases. To illustrate these findings, estimates under different genetic model assumptions are compared and interpreted in a real data example. Models to analyze X chromosome SNPs make assumptions beyond those made in autosomal variant analysis. Assumptions made about X chromosome SNP effects should be stated clearly when reporting and interpreting X chromosome associations.

Pathogenic variants in DDX3X have been shown to cause X-linked intellectual disability (ID) (MRX102, MIM: 300958). The phenotypes associated with DDX3X variants are heterogeneous and include brain and behavioral abnormalities, microcephaly, hypotonia, and movement disorders and/or spasticity. The majority of DDX3X variants described are de novo mutations in females with ID. In contrast, most male DDX3X variants are inherited from an unaffected mother, with one documented exception being a recently identified de novo splice site variant. It has been suggested, therefore, that DDX3X exerts its effects through haploinsufficiency in females, and that affected males carry hypomorphic alleles that retain partial function. Given the lack of male de novo DDX3X variants, loss-of-function variants in this gene are suspected to be male lethal. Through whole-exome sequencing, we identified three unrelated males with hemizygous missense DDX3X variants and ID. All three variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, with two established as de novo. In silico analyses were supportive of pathogenicity.

The mice used for this work combined a spontaneous mutation of the Sty gene with a transgene for Sty that is incorporated into an autosome thus disassociating gonad differentiation from sex chromosome complement. The resulting genotypes are XX and XY- females (ovary-bearing) along with XXSry and XY(-)Sry males (testes-bearing). Here we report results of basic behavioral phenotyping conducted with these mice. Motor coordination, use of olfactory cues to find a food item, general activity, foot shock threshold, and behavior in an elevated plus maze were not affected by gonadal sex or sex chromosome complement. In a one-way active avoidance learning task females were faster to escape an electric shock than males. In addition, sex chromosome complement differences were noted during social interactions with submissive intruders. Female XY- mice were faster to follow an intruder than XX female mice. All XY- mice spent more time sniffing and grooming the intruder than the XX mice, with XY- females spending the most amount of time in this activity. Finally, XX females were faster to display an asocial behavior, digging, and engaged in more digging than XXSry male mice. All of these behaviors were tested in gonadectomized adults, thus, differences in circulating levels of gonadal steroids cannot account for these effects. Taken together, these data show that sex chromosome complement affects social interaction style in mice. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.",experiment,Sty,x,,,,behavior,,mice,,x,,

During preimplantation development, male and female embryos can display phenotypic differences that can only be attributed to the transcriptional differences resulting from their different sex chromosome complements. Thus, all expressed Y-linked genes and those X-linked genes that totally or partially escape X-chromosome inactivation at each specific developmental stage display transcriptional sexual dimorphism. Furthermore, these differentially expressed sex chromosome transcripts can regulate the transcription of autosomal genes, leading to a large transcriptional sexual dimorphism. The sex-dependent transcriptional differences may affect several molecular pathways such as glucose metabolism, DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation, and protein metabolism. These molecular differences may have developmental consequences, including sex-selective embryo loss and sex-specific epigenetic responses to environmental hazards, leading to long-term effects.

It has long been assumed that a large proportion of recurrent spontaneous abortion results from genetic problems, but no causative genes have been identified to date. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a subset of women with recurrent spontaneous abortion are carriers of X-linked recessive disorders that result in the loss of male pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: X chromosome inactivation patterns, an assay used to detect women who are likely to be carriers of X-linked recessive cell-lethal traits, were compared between 105 female patients with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss and 101 women (control subjects) with a single successful pregnancy and no history of pregnancy loss. Inheritance patterns and gender of offspring were studied in relevant subsets of participants. RESULTS: Female patients showed a highly statistically significant increase in the frequency of skewed X chromosome inactivation (90%; P < .0005). Female patients with highly skewed X chromosome inactivation showed a significant decrease in male children. Four of 6 families that were studied showed maternal inheritance of the skewed inactivation trait. CONCLUSION: We found the 14% of women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss show highly skewed X inactivation, which suggests that they are carriers of X-linked recessive lethal traits.

M.","Brahman-cross calves exhibit unusual inheritance of birth weight: Brahman-sired crossbreds out of females are heavier with greater difference between sexes than calves of the reciprocal cross. The objectives of this work were to confirm that unusual inheritance and to investigate non-Mendelian genetic effects that may influence differences in Brahman √ó Simmental crossbred calves. Crossbred calves were produced by embryo transfer ( = 2,862) and natural service or artificial insemination ( = 2,125) from 1983 to 1991 by a private seedstock producer. Brahman-sired F embryos out of Simmental donors weighed 9.4 ¬± 1.1 ( < 0.001) kg more at birth than Simmental-sired F embryos out of Brahman donor cows when transferred to comparable recipients. This reciprocal difference was accompanied by sexual dimorphism: within Brahman-sired F calves, males were 5.0 ¬± 1.4 kg heavier than females, whereas within Simmental-sired F calves, females were 0.7 ¬± 0.5 kg heavier than males. Covariates were constructed from the pedigree to represent genetic effects: proportion Brahman in calves and dams (direct and maternal breed effects), direct and maternal breed heterozygosity, probability of Brahman mitochondrial origin, probability of Brahman Y chromosome, probability of Brahman X chromosome, genomic imprinting (the difference between the probabilities of Brahman in the genetic dam and in the sire), nonrandom X inactivation by breed of origin (the probability of breed heterozygosity of the X chromosomes of a female), and nonrandom X inactivation by parent of origin (the difference between probabilities of a female inheriting a paternal or maternal Brahman X chromosome).

Whilst ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is recognized as the main etiological factor, the relationship between exposure and host phenotype is still unclear. We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane databases for studies assessing the genetic basis of host response to UVR DNA damage, the effect of UVR on generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and their detoxification, UVR induced skin immunity modifications, and the role of genomic instability with a focus on the potential use of these biomarkers to the surgical treatment planning and prognosis of BCC patients. Data suggest that risk for BCC development is likely to result from the combined effect of many genes, each with a relatively weak individual contribution. Certain genomic alterations have been associated with increased or reduced risk for BCC development, with a second primary BCC or with recurrence of BCC. However, use of these biomarkers in everyday practice should be supported by further studies, mainly for its cost-effectiveness. In addition, not enough information exists on the prognostic value of existing demographic and clinical risk predictors for BCC regarding development of second primary or recurrent tumors. Information reviewed suggests that these predictors are of higher predictive value compared with biomarkers whilst they are indisputably cheaper and easier to monitor even in developing countries. Conclusively, we suggest that further studies aimed in investigating second primary or recurrent BCC are needed to provide better information on the predictive value of certain demographic, clinical and histological factors. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, X-chromosome data are often excluded from published analyses of autosomes because of the difference between males and females in number of X chromosomes. Failure to analyze X-chromosome data at all is obviously less than ideal, and can lead to missed discoveries. Even when X-chromosome data are included, they are often analyzed with suboptimal statistics. Several mathematically sensible statistics for X-chromosome association have been proposed. The optimality of these statistics, however, is based on very specific simple genetic models. In addition, while previous simulation studies of these statistics have been informative, they have focused on single-marker tests and have not considered the types of error that occur even under the null hypothesis when the entire X chromosome is scanned. In this study, we comprehensively tested several X-chromosome association statistics using simulation studies that include the entire chromosome. We also considered a wide range of trait models for sex differences and phenotypic effects of X inactivation. We found that models that do not incorporate a sex effect can have large type I error in some cases.

A.","Male and female preimplantation mammalian embryos differ not only in their chromosomal complement, but in their proteome and subsequent metabolome. This phenomenon is due to a finite period during preimplantation development when both X chromosomes are active, between embryonic genome activation and X chromosome inactivation, around the blastocyst stage. Consequently, prior to implantation male and female embryos exhibit differences in their cellular phenotype. Manifestations of such differences include altered total activity of specific X-linked enzymes and the metabolic pathways they regulate. Subsequently, one would expect to be able to determine differences in the rate of consumption and utilization of specific nutrients between male and female embryos. Data to date on animal models support this, with sex-specific differences in glucose and amino acid utilization being reported for the mouse and cow blastocysts. Such differences in metabolic phenotype may logically be involved in the reported differences in growth rates between preimplantation embryos of different sex. As the fields of proteomics and metabolomics are being increasingly applied to human assisted con-ception it is prudent to consider how such technologies may be applied to identify sex differences in the human embryo. Such data would have implications far beyond current invasive technologies used to identify the sex of an embryo conceived in vitro for the diagnosis of X-linked diseases. ¬© The Author 2010.

354,Dosage Compensation of the Sex Chromosomes,2012,"Annual Review of Genetics, Vol 46","Disteche, C. M.","Differentiated sex chromosomes evolved because of suppressed recombination once sex became genetically controlled. In XX/XY and ZZ/ZW systems, the heterogametic sex became partially aneuploid after degeneration of the Y or W. Often, aneuploidy causes abnormal levels of gene expression throughout the entire genome. Dosage compensation mechanisms evolved to restore balanced expression of the genome. These mechanisms include upregulation of the heterogametic chromosome as well as repression in the homogametic sex. Remarkably, strategies for dosage compensation differ between species. In organisms where more is known about molecular mechanisms of dosage compensation, specific protein complexes containing noncoding RNAs are targeted to the X chromosome. In addition, the dosage-regulated chromosome often occupies a specific nuclear compartment. Some genes escape dosage compensation, potentially resulting in sex-specific differences in gene expression. This review focuses on dosage compensation in mammals, with comparisons to fruit flies, nematodes, and birds.",experiment,,x,between species,yes,"dosage compensation, XCI",,,,,,,

L. and Sal√∂, S. and Eliasson, L. and R√∂nn, T. and Bacos, K. and Ling, C.","BACKGROUND: Epigenetic factors regulate tissue-specific expression and X-chromosome inactivation. Previous studies have identified epigenetic differences between sexes in some human tissues. However, it is unclear whether epigenetic modifications contribute to sex-specific differences in insulin secretion and metabolism. Here, we investigate the impact of sex on the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in human pancreatic islets from 53 males and 34 females, and relate the methylome to changes in expression and insulin secretion. RESULTS: Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is higher in female versus male islets. Genome-wide DNA methylation data in human islets clusters based on sex. While the chromosome-wide DNA methylation level on the X-chromosome is higher in female versus male islets, the autosomes do not display a global methylation difference between sexes. Methylation of 8,140 individual X-chromosome sites and 470 autosomal sites shows sex-specific differences in human islets. These include sites in/near AR, DUSP9, HNF4A, BCL11A and CDKN2B. 61 X-chromosome genes and 18 autosomal genes display sex-specific differences in both DNA methylation and expression. These include NKAP, SPESP1 and APLN, which exhibited lower expression in females. Functional analyses demonstrate that methylation of NKAP and SPESP1 promoters in vitro suppresses their transcriptional activity. Silencing of Nkap or Apln in clonal beta-cells results in increased insulin secretion. Differential methylation between sexes is associated with altered levels of microRNAs miR-660 and miR-532 and related target genes. CONCLUSIONS: Chromosome-wide and gene-specific sex differences in DNA methylation associate with altered expression and insulin secretion in human islets. Our data demonstrate that epigenetics contribute to sex-specific metabolic phenotypes.",experiment,"NKAP, SPESP1",,,,"insulin secretion, insulin metabolism",,x,DNA methylation,,,,

Published definitions and classifications of autoimmune diseases differ substantially, as do the F/M ratios themselves. Imputed causality of autoimmune diseases requires better precision. Some thyroid, rheumatic and hepatic diseases consistently have high F/M ratios, but marked differences exist in the reported quantity of the ratios. Other autoimmune diseases have low F/M ratios. Because F/M ratios reflect incidence and not severity of disease, gonadal hormones, if they play a role, must do so through a threshold or permissive mechanism. Sex differences related to environmental exposure, X-inactivation, imprinting, X or Y chromosome genetic modulators, and intrauterine influences remain as alternate, theoretical, explanations for sex differences of incidence. The epidemiology of the sex-discrepant autoimmune diseases - young, female - suggests that an explanation for sex discrepancy lies in differential exposure, vulnerable periods, or thresholds, rather than in quantitative aspects of immunomodulation.",review,,x,,,,autoimmune,,,,,,

Biochemical evidence based on increasing hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) activity during the mouse morula stage indicates that at least one X chromosome is functional. This is corroborated by the observation that mouse embryos lacking an X chromosome do not survive beyond the early cleavage stages. The principal approach to determining whether both X chromosomes are functional before inactivation has been to look at the distributions of the activities of known X-linked enzymes in individual embryos. A bimodal distribution would be expected if dosage compensation had not yet occurred and female embryos with two X chromosomes made twice as much enzyme as male embryos with only one. However, identities of the embryos being assayed are not known, and conclusions based on activity distributions are necessarily inferential. We have circumvented this difficulty by using a method which facilitates determination of the sex of the embryonic material being assayed. This has led to the demonstration that early male and female mouse blastocysts differ twofold in HGPRT activity, a finding indicative of uncompensated X-chromosome dosage dependent gene activity before X-chromosome inactivation.",experiment,,x,,,"XCI, dosage compansation",,,mice,,x,,

Analysis of X linked DNA polymorphism in 16 independent somatic cell hybrids made between cells derived from each girl and a mouse line suggest that in one twin only the maternal X chromosome is active, whereas in the other the active X was paternally derived. More data are needed to exclude sampling error. These preliminary experimental results support the hypothesis that both girls are heterozygous for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

This has led us to propose a novel hypothesis that X-linked imprinting has evolved to control sex specific gene expression in early embryos.

Such alterations might also be involved in the sex-related growth differences in preimplantation embryos found in some animal species. In the present study we analysed cell numbers of human male and female surplus embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage after either IVF or ICSI in order to investigate possible sex-dependent differential growth rates. Methods: Blastocysts resulting from surplus embryos obtained after either IVF or ICSI during a 5 year study period were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: The number of cells and sex could be determined in 330 blastocysts collected from 92 IVF cycles and in 322 blastocysts collected from 121 ICSI cycles. Whereas female and male embryos originating from IVF showed comparable mean log cell numbers per embryo ¬± SEM (3.76 ¬± 0.05 in 147 female and 3.72 ¬± 0.04 in 183 male embryos), significant differences were observed in embryos originating from ICSI (3.57 ¬± 0.05 in 162 female and 3.90 ¬± 0.03 in 160 male embryos). The sex-related growth difference was significantly greater in ICSI than in IVF embryos. In a subset of 84 embryos, inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) were analysed separately.

Conclusion: A clear sex-related growth difference was found in human blastocysts originating from ICSI, but not in blastocysts originating from IVF.

Molecular heterogeneity in the breakpoint positions has been established by probing DNA from these hybrids with a range of cloned sequences known to be located within, or closely linked to, the Duchenne region.

Bovine blastocysts show higher expression of many X genes in XX than XY embryos, suggesting that X inactivation is not complete. Here, we reanalyzed bovine blastocyst microarray expression data from a network perspective with a focus on interactions between X chromosome and autosomal genes. Whereas male-to-female ratios of expression of autosomal genes were distributed around a mean of 1, X chromosome genes were clearly shifted towards higher expression in females. We generated gene coexpression networks and identified a major module of genes with correlated gene expression that includes female-biased X genes and sexually dimorphic autosomal genes for which the sexual dimorphism is likely driven by the X genes. In this module, expression of X chromosome genes correlates with autosome genes, more than the expression of autosomal genes with each other.

Finally, we propose that changes in reproductive ecology in industrialized environments exacerbate these evolved sex differences, resulting in the increasing risk of autoimmune disease observed in females, and a counteracting reduction in diseases such as cancer that can be combated by heightened immune surveillance.

In particular, very recent studies have unraveled striking differences between cells carrying XX or XY chromosomes in terms of response to stressful stimuli, indicating the presence of genetic and epigenetic differences determining sex-specific metabolic or phenotypic traits. Although this field of investigation is still in its infancy, available data suggest a key role of sexual chromosomes in determining cell life or death. In particular, cells carrying XX chromosomes exhibit a higher adaptive potential and survival behavior in response to microenvironmental variations with respect to XY cells. Cells from females also appear to be equipped with more efficient epigenetic machinery than the male counterpart. In particular, the X chromosome contains an unexpected high number of microRNAs (miRs), at present 118, in comparison with only two miRs localized on chromosome Y, and an average of 40-50 on the autosomes. The regulatory power of these small non-coding RNAs is well recognized, as 30-50% of all protein-coding genes are targeted by miRs and their role in cell fate has been well demonstrated. In addition, several further insights, including DNA methylation patterns that are different in males and females, claim for a significant gender disparity in cancer and in the immune system activity against tumors.

This in turn supports the hypothesis that anomalous X-inactivation is involved in the formation of some female MZ twin pairs.",,,,,,,,,,,,x,

In Eutheria, X inactivation is initiated by the large noncoding RNA Xist; however, it is unknown how this RNA results in silencing of the chromosome or why, at least in humans, many genes escape silencing in somatic cells. We have sequenced the coast mole Xist gene and compared the Xist RNA sequence among seven eutherians to provide insight into the structure of the RNA and origins of the gene.

Clinical sequelae of these mutations, which range from severe neonatal lactic acidosis to carbohydrate-sensitive ataxia, can be different in males and females depending on the nature of the mutation and, in the case of females, on the X-inactivation pattern in different tissues. Males have a high representation of missense mutations among the patient cohort, while females are much more likely to have DNA rearrangements, particularly toward the 3' end of the coding sequence of the gene. Missplicing mutations involving exon 6 deletion have been reported, as has a missense mutation conferring true thiamin-responsiveness of the enzyme and the patient's clinical symptoms. Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, on the other hand, is a true autosomal recessive disease, though it has high occurrences in particular ethnic groups, especially in Algonkian-speaking Amerindians and in Arabs. In the former group the defect is a simple type in which material cross-reactive to pyruvate carboxylase antibody is present in cultured cells (CRM(+ve)). In the latter group, cross-reacting material is rarely present (CRM(-ve)).

Previous genome-wide expression studies investigated the whole brain or one single brain region. Here we report a comprehensive study of 480 microarrays analysing genome-wide expression in diverse anatomical structures of the mouse brain, including neocortex, striatum, hippocampus and eye from 240 male and 240 female samples. Lung is also included as a peripheral tissue contrast. Our investigations show specificity in the amount and type of genes with sexual dimorphism in different parts of the brain. For example, applying stringent selection criteria, we identify 173 sex-biased genes in striatum, which are encoded in many different chromosomes. In contrast, using the same criteria, we identify a low amount of sex-biased genes in neocortex (17), hippocampus (12) and eye (22), most of which are encoded on sex chromosomes. A group of these sex-linked genes are biased in the same way on several of the tissues investigated. These shared genes encode Y-chromosome located genes, as well as X-chromosome encoded transcripts known to escape inactivation in the silenced X-chromosome. Alongside with them, we identify five novel X-linked transcripts with up-regulation in several female tissues.

K. and Gyrd-Hansen, M. and Salzer, U. and Speckmann, C. and Grimbacher, B.","PURPOSE: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency caused by mutations in BIRC4 was originally described in male patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 2 (XLP2). Recent observations have highlighted a critical role of XIAP for the regulation of NOD2 signaling and are probably the molecular basis for increasingly recognized further immune dysregulatory symptoms of XIAP deficient patients, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We describe a large Caucasian family in which IBD and erythema nodosum (EN) also manifested in female carriers of XIAP mutations. METHODS: Clinical data and laboratory findings including flow cytometric analysis of XIAP protein expression and sequencing of the BIRC4 gene. NOD2 signaling was investigated by determination of TNFŒ± production in monocytes upon L18-MDP stimulation in vitro. RESULTS: The BIRC4 nonsense mutation p.P225SfsX226 was identified as the genetic cause of XIAP deficiency in our family. Surprisingly, clinical symptoms were not restricted to male patients, but also occurred in several female carriers. The most severely affected carrier demonstrated random X-inactivation, leading to a significant expression of mutated XIAP protein in monocytes, and consequently to impaired NOD2 responses in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our report provides further evidence that clinical symptoms of XIAP deficiency are not restricted to male patients. Random X-inactivation may be associated with EN and mild IBD also in female carriers of BIRC4 mutations. Analysis of the X-inactivation pattern reflected by XIAP protein expression can identify such carriers and the analysis of NOD2 signaling by flow cytometry can confirm the functional significance. XIAP expression patterns should be investigated in female patients with a family history of EN and/or IBD.",experiment,BIRC4,,,,random XCI,"X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency, erythema nodosum,  inflammatory bowel disease",,,Caucasian,x,,

J.","Progress made in the¬†years of aging research have allowed the opportunity to explore potential interventions to slow aging and extend healthy lifespan. Studies performed in yeast, worms, flies and mice subjected to genetic and pharmacological interventions have given insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with longevity. Furthermore, it is now possible to effectively modulate pathways that slow aging at different stages of life (early life or at an adult age). Interestingly, interventions that extend longevity in adult mice¬†have had sex-specific success, suggesting a potential link between particular pathways that modulate aging and sex. For example, reduction of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis at an adult age extends lifespan preferentially in females. Moreover, several postnatal¬†dietary interventions tested by the ‚ÄòIntervention Testing Program (ITP)‚Äô from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) have shown that while pharmacological interventions like rapamycin affect the IGF-1/insulin pathway and preferentially extend lifespan in females; dietary compounds that target other cellular pathways are effective only in male mice‚Äîindicating mutually exclusive sex-specific pathways. Therefore, a combination of interventions that target¬†non-overlapping aging-related pathways appears to be an effective¬†approach to further extend healthy lifespan in both sexes. Here, we review the germline and postnatal mouse lines that target the GH/IGF-1 axis as a mechanism to extend longevity as well as the dietary compounds that tested positive in the NIA program to increase lifespan. We believe that the interventions reviewed in this paper could constitute feasible combinations for an extended healthy lifespan in both male and female mice.",experiment,x,,,,"growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 ",age,,,,x,,

L.","Generally women are believed to be more discriminating than men in the use of color names and this is often taken to imply superior color vision. However, if both X-chromosome linked color deficient males (‚àº8%) and females (<1%) as well as heterozygote female carriers (‚àº15%) are excluded from comparisons, then differences between men and women in red-green (RG) color discrimination have been reported as not being significant (e.g., Pickford, 1944; Hood et al., 2006). We re-examined this question by assessing the performance of 150 males and 150 females on the color assessment and diagnosis (CAD) test (Rodriguez-Carmona et al., 2005). This is a sensitive test that yields small color detection thresholds. The test employs direction-specific, moving, chromatic stimuli embedded in a background of random, dynamic, luminance contrast noise. A four-alternative, forced-choice procedure is employed to measure the subject's thresholds for detection of color signals in 16 directions in color space, while ensuring that the subject cannot make use of any residual luminance contrast signals. In addition, we measured the Rayleigh anomaloscope matches in a subgroup of 111 males and 114 females. All the age-matched males (30.8 ¬± 9.7) and females (26.7 ¬± 8.8) had normal color vision as diagnosed by a battery of conventional color vision tests. Females with known color deficient relatives were excluded from the study. Comparisons between the male and female groups revealed no significant differences in anomaloscope midpoints (p = 0.709), but a significant difference in matching ranges (p = 0.040); females on average tended to have a larger mean range (4.11) than males (3.75). Females also had significantly higher CAD thresholds than males along the RG (p = 0.0004), but not along the yellow-blue (YB) discrimination axis. The differences between males and females in RG discrimination may be related to the heterozygosity in X-linked cone photo pigment expression common among females.

J.","Family-based association methods for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been developed primarily for autosomes, and comparable methods for X-linked QTL have received less attention. We have developed a family-based association test for quantitative traits, named XQTL, which uses X-linked markers in a nuclear family design. XQTL adopts the framework of the orthogonal model implemented in the QTDT program, modifying the sex-specific score for X-linked genotypes. XQTL also takes into account the dosage effect due to female X chromosome inactivation. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) and Fisher's scoring method are used to estimate variance components of random effects. Fixed effects, derived from the phenotypic differences among and within families, are estimated by the least-squares method. Our proposed XQTL can perform allelic and two-locus haplotypic association tests and can provide estimates of additive genetic effects and variance components. Simulation studies show correct type I error rates under the null hypothesis and robust statistical power under alternative scenarios. The loss of power observed when parental genotypes are missing can be compensated by an increase of offspring number.

Without careful methodology, the pursuit of sex difference research, despite a mandate from funding agencies, will result in a literature of contradiction.

395,Androgen spares androgen-insensitive motoneurons from apoptosis in the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus in rats,1996,Hormones and Behavior,"Freeman, L. M. and Watson, N. V. and Breedlove, S. M.","The spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus (SNB) is a sexually dimorphic motor nucleus in the rat lumbar spinal cord. The sex difference arises through the androgenic sparing of the motoneurons and their target muscles from ontogenetic cell death. Indirect evidence suggests that androgen acts on the target muscles rather than directly on SNB motoneurons to spare them from death. The testicular feminization mutation (Tfm), a defect in the androgen receptor (AR), blocks androgenic sparing of SNB motoneurons and their targets. The pattern of AR immunocytochemistry was previously found to be different in adult Tfm and wild-type rats: immunostaining was nuclear in most SNB cells of wild-type rats, but very few SNB cells display nuclear AR immunostaining in affected Tfm rats. Because the Tfm mutation is carried on the X chromosome, random X inactivation during development makes female carriers of Tfm (+/Ttm) genetic mosaics for androgen sensitivity. Tfm carriers, their wild-type sisters, and affected Tfm males were treated with perinatal testosterone and immunocytochemistry was used to detect androgen receptor in the SNB when the rats reached adulthood. Mosaic females could be distinguished from their wild-type sisters by external morphology. In such perinatally androgenized mosaics, adult SNB cells were equally divided between wild-type and Tfm genotype, as indicated by AR immunocytochemistry. In contrast, the pattern of AR immunocytochemistry in target muscles of mosaics appeared similar to that of wild-type females. These results indicate that early androgen spared both androgen-sensitive and -insensitive motoneurons from cell death, confirming a site of androgen action other than the motoneurons themselves.",experiment,Tfm,,,,mosaicism,,,mice,,,x,

Although recent studies have evaluated the differences in the clinical features and prognosis between the two sexes, many issues remain to be elucidated. At present, the only sex-specific condition that affects females is peripartum cardiomyopathy. Recent evidence suggests a pathogenetic role of a prolactin derivative, and ongoing clinical trials are investigating the possibility of targeted therapies using prolactin secretion inhibitors, such as bromocriptine and carbegoline. Although women were considered so far only carriers of X-linked diseases (Anderson-Fabry disease, Danon disease, Hunter syndrome and dystrophinopathies), clinical experience showed a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in females due to random X chromosome inactivation. Conversely, in mitochondrial diseases (with matrilineal inheritance), cardiomyopathies may occur in the context of clinical multisystemic involvement without significant gender-related differences. Autosomal inherited cardiomyopathies also show different phenotypes and prognostic impact according to gender. The hypothesis of a premenopausal protective role of female hormones towards myocardial involvement has been raised by recent data on transtiretin-related amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Preexisting cardiomyopathies may affect pregnancy, labor and delivery in women, since all these conditions are associated with important hemodynamic changes. Women with low-risk hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (asymptomatic and without left ventricular outflow tract gradient) usually can tolerate pregnancy. Conversely, women who are symptomatic before pregnancy or have severe hypertrophy with important outflow tract gradient are at higher risk and should be referred to a tertiary center to be evaluated on a case by case basis. Pregnancy in women with dilated cardiomyopathy and significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction represents a high-risk condition. In addition, information on the clinical course and potential complications in pregnant women with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy or restrictive cardiomyopathy is limited to individual reports. ¬© 2012 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore.",review,,,,,mosaicism,cardiomyopathy,,,,x,,

Findings: A total of 142 prepubertal children, 66 girls and 76 boys, suffering from severe sepsis and admitted to the PICU were included. The survival rate demonstrated a tendency to be higher in females (P = 0.14).

This report describes the results from factor VIII gene (F8) analysis of a New Zealand cohort of 45 proband HA patients. We screened all proband HA patients attending local clinics to determine the molecular basis of disease in each case. We also aimed to evaluate the significance of founder effect in this population and to explain an unusual case of HA in a female patient. HA patients were screened for the common F8 gene inversion mutations using previously described PCR-based techniques, and for single base substitution mutations using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and DNA sequencing. Analysis of microsatellite markers located within or near F8 was used to determine identity by descent and trace inheritance patterns of disease alleles. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) patterns were detected using methylation specific PCR. Pathogenic F8 gene mutations were detected in all 45 HA patients in this cohort and non-random XCI was confirmed in a female haemophiliac. We report nine novel F8 mutations, including two splicing mutations, a five nucleotide deletion and a large deletion at the 5‚Ä≤ end of the gene. The molecular aetiology of HA was similar to that described in other studies but the distribution of mutations was unusual due to founder effects, with almost a quarter of all probands being descended from just three individuals. ¬© 2007 The Authors Journal compliation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",experiment,F8,,,,,haemophilia A,,,,x,,

A fascinating aspect of evolution is the differentiation of sex chromosomes. Organisms with highly differentiated sex chromosomes, such as the mammalian X and Y, must compensate for the imbalance in gene dosage that this creates. The need to adjust the expression of sex-linked genes is a potent force driving the rise of regulatory mechanisms that act on an entire chromosome. This review will contrast the process of dosage compensation in Drosophila with the divergent strategies adopted by other model organisms. While the machinery of sex chromosome compensation is different in each instance, all share the ability to direct chromatin modifications to an entire chromosome. This review will also explore the idea that chromosome-targeting systems are sometimes adapted for other purposes.

Xist is known to be controlled by the non-coding Xite and Tsix loci, but the mechanisms by which Tsix and Xite regulate Xist are yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we examine the role of higher order chromatin structure across the 100-kb region of the mouse X-inactivation center (Xic) and map domains of specialized chromatin in vivo. By hypersensitive site mapping and chromosome conformation capture (3C), we identify two domains of higher order chromatin structure. Xite makes looping interactions with Tsix, while Xist makes contacts with Jpx/Enox, another non-coding gene not previously implicated in XCI. These regions interact in a developmentally-specific and sex-specific manner that is consistent with a regulatory role in XCI. We propose that dynamic changes in three-dimensional architecture leads to formation of separate chromatin hubs in Tsix and Xist that together regulate the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Inc.
