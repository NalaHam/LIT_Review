Familiarity and high concordance rates for the disease among monozygotic twins strongly support the role of genetics in the disease. Experimental efforts have been dedicated by our and other research groups to investigate the role of X chromosome abnormalities (i.e. monosomyrates and inactivation patterns) in autoimmunity. Our recent work has demonstrated enhanced X monosomy in women with PBC as well as two other female-predominant autoimmune diseases, systemic sclerosis and autoimmune thyroid disease. We will review herein the most recent evidence on the role of the X chromosome in PBC onset and discuss the potential implications. Future developments of these findings will be discussed. © 2007 The Japan Society of Hepatology.","L47570649 2007-10-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: body,autoimmune",10.1111/j.1872-034X.2007.00223.x,"estrogen receptor;adaptive immunity;autoimmune disease;autoimmunity;B lymphocyte;chromosome inactivation;conference paper;DNA methylation;environmental factor;epigenetics;gene mapping;genetic susceptibility;heredity;human;monosomy;monozygotic twins;pathogenesis;peripheral blood mononuclear cell;phenotype;primary biliary cirrhosis;priority journal;sex difference;systemic sclerosis;thyroid disease;X chromosome aberration;X chromosome linkage;X Chromosome;Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary",,

Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are complex autoimmune disorder related by B cell hyperactivity resulting in autoantibody and cytokine production. Approximately 90% of patients are female. We have produced data showing an X-chromosome gene dose effect or simply the number of X chromosomes increases susceptibility. Therefore, our objective is to functionally describe the protein encoded by the gene Chromosome X open reading frame 21 (CXorf21), which escapes X inactivation and is a lupus risk gene, to uncover any role this protein may have in the pathogenesis or susceptibility to SS and SLE. Publically available data predict CXorf21 is a dehydrogenase/reductase expressed almost exclusively in B cells and myeloid lineage antigen-presenting cells. Additional studies show that CXorf21 directly interacts with another SS/SLE-associated risk allele, Slc15A4. SLC15a4, a pH-sensitive lysosomal proton-oligopeptide co-transporter; and, is necessary for lysosomal antigen processing, TLR7-and NOD1-mediated cytokine as well as antibody production in dendritic cells and B cells. Methods. We used quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot protein analysis, immunofluorescence, pHrodo™ and Lysosensor™ assays, as well as, in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments to examine the role of CXorf21 in monocytes and B cell immunity. Results. Our in vitro qPCR data confirm CXorf21 expression in CD19+ B cells and monocytes. Preliminary immunofluorescence studies show that CXorf21 is a cytosolic rather than nuclear protein. Our data show that CXorf21 basal gene and protein expression is elevated more than 1.5-fold in female primary monocytes compared to male cells. Additionally, we found that following a time-and concentration-dependent activation by TLR7 (Imiquimod [2μM]) or NOD1 (C12-iE-DAP [20μM]) agonists, resulted in TLR7 and CXorf21 expression increase 3-and 5-fold, respectively. Successful knockdown of CXorf21, using CXorf21-specific gRNA (CRISPRCas9), abrogated this effect. Initial pHrodo™ [20μg/ml] and Lysosensor™ [10μM] lysosomal experiments revealed that healthy male primary monocytes trend toward a higher pH, while healthy female monocytes lysosomes had a lower pH, and knockdown of CXorf21 protein resulted in an increased lysosomal pH in female monocytes, and no change in the male sample. Furthermore, treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) increased lysosomal pH in female cells. Conclusion. CXorf21 is over-expressed in female immune cells compared to male cells, and is involved in a sex-dependent dimorphic response to activation through TLR7 or NOD1. In addition, lysosomal pH is regulated by CXorf21 is a sexually dimorphic manner. We propose that CXorf21 maintains the lysosome pH environment necessary for monocyte and B cell immune response. Thus, sexual dimorphic expression of CXorf21, based on escape of X chromosome inactivation, skews (auto) antigen processing and immune response by women compared to men. CXorf21 may be a major contributor to disease pathogenesis, and sex bias of the diseases based on an X chromosome dosage effect.","L629437201 2019-10-02 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune,very relevant",,autoantigen;caspase recruitment domain protein 4;cotransporter;cytokine;endogenous compound;hydroxychloroquine;imiquimod;nuclear protein;oligopeptide;oxidoreductase;toll like receptor 7;adult;allele;antibody production;antigen presentation;conference abstract;controlled study;CRISPR-CAS9 system;dendritic cell;dose response;enzyme activity;female;gene overexpression;genetic association;genetic susceptibility;human;human cell;humoral immunity;immunocompetent cell;immunofluorescence;in vitro study;lysosome;male;monocyte;open reading frame;protein expression;protein function;quantitative analysis;real time polymerase chain reaction;systemic lupus erythematosus;Western blotting;X chromosome inactivation;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Although many factors may be contributing to this phenomenon, the exact underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Apart from the traditionally considered hormonal and environmental factors, lately the role of sex chromosomes and especially of the X chromosome has drawn much attention. In the current review, we focus on the inherent genetic imbalance between the sex chromosomes and their influence and role on gender-discordant disease presentation. To compensate for this imbalance, nature has created a defective epigenetic mechanism to silence the second rich in immune related genes X chromosome. Genes escaping silencing, transfer the genetic imbalance into the transcriptional and protein level, contributing to gender differences as reflected in functions of the innate and adaptive immunity. Under this prism, recent research data on SS, regarding specific immune X-linked loci are being presented and analysed. The ""X Factor""in the search for an explication of women's predilection in autoimmunity, may lie behind these unique properties of the X chromosome.","L2017832092 2022-05-03 2022-05-25 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.55563/clinexprheumatol/88dyrn,CD40 ligand;chemokine receptor CCR3;chromosome X open reading frame 21;hormone;interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase;membrane protein;toll like receptor 7;unclassified drug;adaptive immunity;autoimmunity;chromosome analysis;chromosome X open reading frame 21 gene;environmental factor;epigenetics;gender bias;gene;gene expression;gene silencing;gene transfer;genetic susceptibility;genetic transcription;human;immune-related gene;innate immunity;nonhuman;review;sex chromosome;sex difference;Sjoegren syndrome;systemic autoimmune disease;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome,,

About three fourth of the patients afflicted with AIDs are women suggesting that sex differences impact the incidence of AID. However, the proportion of females to males suffering from AID varies depending on the disease. The response to some AID therapeutics also differs in females versus males, suggesting that enrollment of adequate numbers of women and men is important in clinical trials for development of AID drugs. It is known for a long time that genetic factors are important contributors to AID susceptibility. Currently available information suggests that multiple genes with modest association to AID contribute to susceptibility to AID. Also, the associations may differ for the various ethnicities. The major histocompatibility (MHC) locus appears to be a major genetic factor that confers susceptibility to multiple AIDs, even though the locus is complex and has the highest density of genes in the human genome. Thus, the association of different AIDs could be with different genes in the MHC locus. Among the non-MHC genes, some of the risk alleles are shared between different AIDs, but may not be common to all AIDs. For example, genetic polymorphisms in the Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase-22 (PTPN22) gene have reproducibly shown to have association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Graves' disease (GD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS), but not with psoriasis. Identification of factors responsible for risk for developing AID and the of the pathways underlying these diseases are likely to help understand subsets of disease, identify responders to a specific treatment and develop better therapeutics for AID. © 2011.","L51786452 2011-12-29 2012-04-02 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1016/j.jaut.2011.12.001,azathioprine;cyclophosphamide;fingolimod;major histocompatibility antigen class 1;major histocompatibility antigen class 2;mitoxantrone;natalizumab;non receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase 22;steroid;Addison disease;ankylosing spondylitis;article;autoimmune disease;autoimmune hepatitis;autoimmune thyroiditis;autoimmunity;celiac disease;chronic active hepatitis;clinical trial (topic);dermatomyositis;disease predisposition;dizygotic twins;DNA methylation;drug screening;enteritis;environmental factor;ethnicity;gene expression profiling;genetic association;genetic polymorphism;genetic risk;genetic susceptibility;genomics;glomerulonephritis;Goodpasture syndrome;Graves disease;Guillain Barre syndrome;heredity;histone modification;human;hypothyroidism;immunoglobulin A nephropathy;immunosuppressive treatment;insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;major histocompatibility complex;medication therapy management;monosomy X;monozygotic twins;multiple sclerosis;myasthenia gravis;pernicious anemia;polymyositis;prevalence;primary biliary cirrhosis;priority journal;psoriasis;rheumatoid arthritis;sex difference;Sjoegren syndrome;steroid therapy;survival rate;systemic lupus erythematosus;systemic sclerosis;T lymphocyte;thyroid function;thyroidectomy;treatment outcome;treatment response;twin concordance;uveitis;vitiligo;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Sex Characteristics;Autoimmune Diseases;Genome;Genomics,,

For this reason, X chromosome has recently become subject of great interest and attention and numerous studies have been aimed at understanding the role of genes on the X chromosome in triggering and maintaining the autoimmune aggression. Autoimmune diseases are indeed a growing heath burden affecting cumulatively up to 10% of the general population. It is intriguing that most X-linked primary immune deficiencies carry significant autoimmune manifestations, thus illustrating the critical role played by products of single gene located on the X chromosome in the onset, function and homeostasis of the immune system. Again, the plethora of autoimmune stigmata observed in patients with Turner syndrome, a disease due to the lack of one X chromosome or the presence of major X chromosome deletions, indicate that X-linked genes play a unique and major role in autoimmunity. There have been several reports on a role of X chromosome gene dosage through inactivation or duplication in women with autoimmune diseases, for example through a higher rate of circulating cells with a single X chromosome (i.e. with X monosomy). Finally, a challenge for researchers in the coming years will be to dissect the role for the large number of X-linked microRNAs from the perspective of autoimmune disease development. Taken together, X chromosome might well constitute the common trait of the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, other than to explain the female preponderance of these conditions. This review will focus on the available evidence on X chromosome changes and discuss their potential implications and limitations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","L51768939 2011-12-20 2012-04-02 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1016/j.jaut.2011.11.012,CD11 antigen;CD40 ligand;CD70 antigen;microRNA;article;autoimmune disease;autoimmunity;CD4+ T lymphocyte;chromosome deletion X;chromosome inactivation;chromosome mutation;gene dosage;genetic predisposition;genetic risk;geographic distribution;heredity;heterochromatin;human;hyper IgM syndrome;immune response gene;immunoregulation;IPEX syndrome;major histocompatibility complex;monosomy X;mosaicism;nonhuman;priority journal;sex difference;Turner syndrome;Wiskott Aldrich syndrome;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X linked severe combined immunodeficiency;Y chromosome;X Chromosome,,

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to confirm a role for XCI skewing as a potential explanation for the strong female preponderance seen in AITD. DESIGN: The design of the study was to screen XCI in the largest GD, HT, and control case-control cohort and family cohort to date and undertake a meta-analysis of previous AITD XCI reports. SETTING: The study was conducted at a research laboratory. PATIENTS: Three hundred and nine GD, 490 HT, and 325 female UK Caucasians controls, 273 UK Caucasian GD families, and a meta-analysis of 454 GD, 673 HT, and 643 female Caucasian controls were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Case-control and family-based association studies and meta-analysis were measured. RESULTS: Skewed XCI was observed with GD [odds ratio (OR) 2.17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-3.30], P=2.1×10(-4)] and a trend toward skewing with HT (P=.08) compared with the control cohort. A meta-analysis of our UK data and that of four previous non-UK Caucasian studies confirmed significant skewing of XCI with GD [OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.58-4.10), P=1.0×10(-4), I2=30.2%] and HT [OR 2.40 (95% CI 1.10-5.26), P=.03, I2=74.3%]. CONCLUSIONS: Convincing evidence exists to support a role for skewed XCI in female subjects with AITD, which may, in part, explain the strong female preponderance observed in this disease.","1945-7197 Simmonds, Matthew J Kavvoura, Fotini K Brand, Oliver J Newby, Paul R Jackson, Laura E Hargreaves, Chantal E Franklyn, Jayne A Gough, Stephen C L 068181/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom Journal Article Meta-Analysis Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2013/11/05 J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2014 Jan;99(1):E127-31. doi: 10.1210/jc.2013-2667.

One of the major shared features among AID is the predominance in the female sex which in some cases changes with the age at disease diagnosis. Numerous hypotheses have been formulated based on intuitive scientific backgrounds to justify this sex imbalance, i.e. sex hormones and reproductive factors, fetal microchimerism, other sex-related environmental factors, a skewing of the X-chromosome inactivation patterns, and major defects in sex chromosomes. Nevertheless, none of these hypotheses has thus far gathered enough convincing evidence and in most cases data are conflicting, as well illustrated by the reports on fetal microchimerism in systemic sclerosis or primary biliary cirrhosis. The present article will critically discuss the main hypotheses (loss of mosaicism, reactivation, and haploinsufficiency) that have been proposed based on findings in female patients with specific AID along with two additional mechanisms (X-chromosome vulnerability and X-linked polyamine genes) that have been observed in AID models. Further, recent data have significantly shifted the paradigm of X chromosome inactivation by demonstrating that a large number of genes can variably escape silencing on one or both chromosomes. As a result we may hypothesize that more than one mechanism may contribute to the female susceptibility to tolerance breakdown while the possibility that unknown factors may indeed protect men from AID should not be overlooked.","1873-0183 Selmi, Carlo Brunetta, Enrico Raimondo, Maria Gabriella Meroni, Pier Luigi Journal Article Review Netherlands 2011/12/14 Autoimmun Rev. 2012 May;11(6-7):A531-7. doi: 10.1016/j.autrev.2011.11.024.

Sex hormones might influence the target organ's vulnerability to an autoimmune response. Gender differences also exist in organ specific autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Crohn's disease and celiac disease. Nevertheless, other organ specific autoimmune diseases (i.e. ulcerative colitis) are seemingly characterized with similar prevalence in both males and females. The reason for gender differences in certain autoimmune diseases remains unknown, but may be attributed to sex hormone influence, fetal microchimerism, X chromosome inactivation, and X chromosome abnormalities. Sex hormones have been found to have immune modulating properties, as well as providing cellular protection following tissue damage in certain circumstances. Sex hormones also influence innate and adaptive immune cells, number of B and T cells, antigen presentation and cytokine secretion.

A. and Bourke, N. M. and O'Farrelly, C.",,,,,"Type I interferons (IFN-I) and their cognate receptor, the IFNAR1/2 heterodimer, are critical components of the innate immune system in humans. They have been widely explored in the context of viral infection and autoimmune disease where they play key roles in protection against infection or shaping disease pathogenesis. A false dichotomy has emerged in the study of IFN-I where interferons are thought of as either beneficial or pathogenic. This 'good or bad' viewpoint excludes more nuanced interpretations of IFN-I biology - for example, it is known that IFN-I is associated with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, yet is also protective in the context of infectious diseases and contributes to resistance to viral infection. Studies have suggested that a shared transcriptomic signature underpins both potential resistance to viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmune disease. This seems to be particularly evident in females, who exhibit increased viral resistance and increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease. The molecular mechanisms behind such a signature and the role of sex in its determination have yet to be precisely defined. From a genomic perspective, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFN-I pathway have been associated with both infectious and autoimmune disease. While overlap between infection and autoimmunity has been described in the incidence of these SNPs, it has been overlooked in work and discussion to date. Here, we discuss the possible contributions of IFN-Is to the pathogenesis of infectious and autoimmune diseases. We comment on genetic associations between common SNPs in IFN-I or their signalling molecules that point towards roles in protection against viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmunity and propose that a shared transcriptomic and genomic immunological signature may underlie resistance to viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmunity in humans. We believe that defining shared transcriptomic and genomic immunological signatures underlying resistance to viral infection and autoimmunity in humans will reveal new therapeutic targets and improved vaccine strategies, particularly in females.","1664-3224 Sugrue, Jamie A Bourke, Nollaig M O'Farrelly, Cliona Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review Switzerland 2021/12/18 Front Immunol. 2021 Nov 30;12:757249. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.757249. eCollection 2021. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.3389/fimmu.2021.757249,"Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics/immunology;Autoimmunity/genetics/immunology;Disease Resistance/genetics/immunology;Female;Gene Expression Regulation/genetics/immunology;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics;Humans;Interferon Type I/*immunology/physiology;Male;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta/genetics;Selection, Genetic;Sex Characteristics;TYK2 Kinase/genetics;Toll-Like Receptor 3/genetics;*Transcriptome;Virus Diseases/*genetics/immunology;X Chromosome Inactivation;autoimmunity;genetics;infection;sexual dimorphism;type I interferons;viral resistance;Interferon Type I;Autoimmune Diseases;Genomics;Genome;Interferons",,

S. and Pang, K. and Saffery, R. and Novakovic, B.",,,,,"Sexual dimorphism refers to differences between biological sexes that extend beyond sexual characteristics. In humans, sexual dimorphism in the immune response has been well demonstrated, with females exhibiting lower infection rates than males for a variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. There is also a substantially increased incidence of autoimmune disease in females compared to males. Together, these trends indicate that females have a heightened immune reactogenicity to both self and non-self-molecular patterns. However, the molecular mechanisms driving the sexually dimorphic immune response are not fully understood. The female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, as well as the male androgens, such as testosterone, elicit direct effects on the function and inflammatory capacity of immune cells. Several studies have identified a sex-specific transcriptome and methylome, independent of the well-described phenomenon of X-chromosome inactivation, suggesting that sexual dimorphism also occurs at the epigenetic level. Moreover, distinct alterations to the transcriptome and epigenetic landscape occur in synchrony with periods of hormonal change, such as puberty, pregnancy, menopause, and exogenous hormone therapy. These changes are also mirrored by changes in immune cell function. This review will outline the evidence for sex hormones and pregnancy-associated hormones as drivers of epigenetic change, and how this may contribute to the sexual dimorphism. Determining the effects of sex hormones on innate immune function is important for understanding sexually dimorphic autoimmune diseases, sex-specific responses to pathogens and vaccines, and how innate immunity is altered during periods of hormonal change (endogenous or exogenous).","1664-3224 Shepherd, Rebecca Cheung, Ada S Pang, Ken Saffery, Richard Novakovic, Boris Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review Switzerland 2021/02/16 Front Immunol. 2021 Jan 21;11:604000. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.604000. eCollection 2020. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.3389/fimmu.2020.604000,"Age Factors;Animals;Autoimmunity;*Epigenesis, Genetic;*Epigenome;Estrogen Replacement Therapy;Estrogens/metabolism;Female;Gonadal Steroid Hormones/*metabolism/therapeutic use;Humans;*Immunity, Innate/drug effects;Male;Progesterone/metabolism;*Sex Characteristics;Sex Factors;Sexual Development;Testosterone/metabolism;cross-sex hormone treatment;epigenetics;innate immunity;pregnancy hormones;progesterone and estradiol;sexual dimorphism;Gonadal Steroid Hormones",,

Unstimulated pDCs with biallelic TLR7 expression exhibit significantly higher IFNα/β mRNA levels, and IFNα exposure results in significantly increased IFNα/β protein production by pDCs.

Recent evidence suggests that the presence of two X chromosomes may underlie the female bias in pSS. However, the exact X chromosomal alterations on a single-gene level in pSS and their contribution to the female bias in pSS remain elusive. The objective of this study is to define the contribution of X-linked gene expression to pSS pathogenesis, focusing on minor salivary gland-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) which are critical players maintaining salivary gland homeostasis. Methods: Genome-wide, allele-specific expression profiling was performed using MSCs derived from female pSS subjects meeting 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria (n=4) and female control subjects with sicca symptoms but without clinical or laboratory features of autoimmunity (n=4). qRT-PCR of XIST (X-inactive-specific transcript) and quantitative immunostaining of H3K27me3 were performed to assess status of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in pSS and control MSCs. Protein localization was analyzed by quantitative immunofluorescence in pSS and control MSCs. Expression levels of IL4 were measured by qRT-PCR before and after MSC adipogenesis to assess the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs. Student's t-test (two-sample, unequal variances) was used to compare experiment versus control groups for statistical significance. Results: All pSS MSCs analyzed demonstrated marked skewing of X-linked genes that escape XCI (i.e. escapees), while all control MSCs exhibited balanced escapee expression (Fig. 1). Concomitantly, pSS MSCs showed decrease in XIST expression levels (P < 0.05) and reorganization of heterochromatic, silencing foci in the nucleus (P < 0.05), suggesting a global disruption in XCI maintenance (Fig. 2). The skewing in X-inactivation escape in pSS MSCs was accompanied by mislocalization of protein products encoded by the escapees as well as inflammatory differentiation of MSCs (P < 0.05), consistent with the hallmark features of inflammation and fibrosis in pSS salivary glands (Fig. 3). Conclusion: We discovered global skewing of X-linked genes in pSS but not control MSCs, and identified escapee skewing as a new mechanism underlying pSS pathogenesis. Given that XCI is a female-specific process, our data suggests that dysregulation of XCI escape contributes to the female bias in pSS.","L637274778 2022-02-23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune,infectious,very relevant",10.1002/art.41966,endogenous compound;histone H3;interleukin 4;adipogenesis;adult;allele;autoimmunity;case report;clinical article;conference abstract;female;fibrosis;gene expression;genetic transcription;homeostasis;human;human cell;immunofluorescence;immunohistochemistry;inflammation;mesenchymal stroma cell;minor saliva gland;protein expression;protein fingerprinting;protein localization;quantitative analysis;real time polymerase chain reaction;salivary gland;statistical significance;X chromosome inactivation;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Here, high-throughput gene expression analysis in CD4+ T cells showed that the top sexually dimorphic gene was Kdm6a, a histone demethylase on the X chromosome. There was higher expression of Kdm6a in females compared with males in humans and mice, and the four core genotypes (FCG) mouse model showed higher expression in XX compared with XY. Deletion of Kdm6a in CD4+ T cells ameliorated clinical disease and reduced neuropathology in the classic CD4+ T cell-mediated autoimmune disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Global transcriptome analysis in CD4+ T cells from EAE mice with a specific deletion of Kdm6a showed upregulation of Th2 and Th1 activation pathways and downregulation of neuroinflammation signaling pathways.

Unlike in humans, mouse p-DCs do not exhibit sex differences with interferon alpha production, and interferon signature gene expression in p-DCs is similar between males and females.

In some cases (diseases of sex organs, diseases resulting from X or Y chromosome mutations), reasons for sex discrepancy are obvious, but in other cases no reason is apparent. Explanations for sex discrepancy of illness occur at different biological levels: molecular (e.g., imprinting, X-inactivation), cellular (sex-specific receptor activity), organ (endocrine influences), whole organism (size, age), and environmental-behavioral, including intrauterine influences. Autoimmunity represents a prototypical class of illness that has high female-to-male (F/M) ratios. Although the F/M ratios in autoimmune diseases are usually attributed to the influence of estrogenic hormones, evidence demonstrates that the attributed ratios are imprecise and that definitions and classifications of autoimmune diseases vary, rendering at least part of the counting imprecise. In addition, many studies on sex discrepancy of human disease fail to distinguish between disease incidence and disease severity. In April 2001, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences published Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter? (Wizemann T and Pardue M-L, editors). This minireview summarizes the section of that report that concerns autoimmune and infectious disease. Some thyroid, rheumatic, and hepatic autoimmune diseases have high F/M ratios, whereas others have low. Those that have high ratios occur primarily in young adulthood. Gonadal hormones, if they play a role, likely do so through a threshold or permissive mechanism. Examples of sex differences that could be caused by environmental exposure, X inactivation, imprinting, X or Y chromosome genetic modulators, and intrauterine influences are presented as alternate, theoretical, and largely unexplored explanations for sex differences of incidence. The epidemiology of autoimmune diseases (young, female) suggests that an explanation for sex discrepancy of these illnesses lies in differential exposure, vulnerable periods, or thresholds. Biologists have an opportunity to inform medical scientists about sex differences that explain different attack rates in specific diseases, and physicians offer biologists experiments of nature to test theories of sex.","L33015094 2001-11-13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1152/jappl.2001.91.5.2366,estrogen;hormone;autoimmune disease;autoimmunity;disease severity;environmental exposure;female;gene mutation;genome;human;male;priority journal;review;rheumatic disease;sex difference;X chromosome aberration;Y chromosome linked disorder;Genome;Rheumatic Diseases;Sex Ratio;Genomics,,

Autoimmunity is the third most common type of disease in the United States. Because there is no cure for autoimmunity, it is extremely important to study the mechanisms that trigger these diseases. Most autoimmune diseases predominantly affect females, indicating a strong sex bias. Various factors, including sex hormones, the presence or absence of a second X chromosome, and sex-specific gut microbiota can influence gene expression in a sex-specific way. These changes in gene expression may, in turn, lead to susceptibility or protection from autoimmunity, creating a sex bias for autoimmune diseases.

X chromosome-dosage increases susceptibility to SLE and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Chromosome X open reading frame 21 (CXorf21) escapes X-inactivation and is an SLE risk gene of previously unknown function. We undertook the present study to delineate the function of CXorf21 in the immune system as well as investigate a potential role in the sex bias of SLE and pSS. Methods: Western blot protein analysis, qPCR, BioPlex cytokine immunoassay, pHrodo™ assays, as well as in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments were employed to delineate the role of CXorf21 in relevant immunocytes. Results: Expressed in monocytes and B cells, CXorf21 basal Mrna, and protein expression levels are elevated in female primary monocytes, B cells, and EBV-transformed B cells compared to male cells. We also found CXorf21 mRNA and protein expression is higher in both male and female cells from SLE patients compared to control subjects. TLR7 ligation increased CXorf21 protein expression and CXorf21 knockdown abrogated TLR7-driven increased IFNA1 mRNA expression, and reduced secretion of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 in healthy female monocytes. Similarly, we found increased pH in the lysosomes of CXorf21-deficient female monocytes. Conclusion: CXorf21 is more highly expressed in female compared to male cells and is involved in a sexually dimorphic response to TLR7 activation. In addition, CXorf21 expression regulates lysosomal pH in a sexually dimorphic manner. Thus, sexually dimorphic expression of CXorf21 skews cellular immune responses in manner consistent with expected properties of a mediator of the X chromosome dose risk in SLE and pSS.","1664-3224 Harris, Valerie M Koelsch, Kristi A Kurien, Biji T Harley, Isaac T W Wren, Jonathan D Harley, John B Scofield, R Hal P30 AR073750/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States T32 AR007534/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States U19 AI082714/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States U54 GM104938/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) release IFN-α upon TLR7 and TLR9 ligation. With respect to the nine times higher incidence of SLE in women and the clinical use of synthetic TLR ligands as novel immune adjuvants, we analyzed IFN-α and TNF-α production in healthy human individuals. Blood samples were incubated with synthetic TLR7 and TLR9 ligands. In three independent groups (n1 = 120, n2 = 101, and n3 = 123), analysis revealed a capacity of female PBLs to produce significantly higher IFN-α levels after TLR7 stimulation (p1, < 0.0000001, p2 < 0.0000001, and p3 < 0.0001) compared with male PBLs. In contrast, no sex differences were evident after TLR9 stimulation. TNF-α production after TLR7 stimulation and also total pDC numbers were not different between females and males. X-inactivation escape of the TLR7 gene was investigated in monoclonal B cell lines and, independently, in pDCs after cell sorting and single-cell picking, indicating regular silencing of one TLR7 allele in females. Additionally, exogenous 17β-estrogen and estrogen receptor antagonism did not indicate a significant role on TLR7-induced IFN-α production. Our data reveal for the first time a profound sex-dependent pathway of TLR7-induced IFN-α with higher production in females. These findings may explain the higher prevalence of SLE in females and the reported decreased therapeutic efficacy of synthetic TLR7 ligands in male individuals.

Design: Case-control study. Participants: Four hundred sixty-eight Taiwan-Chinese patients with GD; 200 of these patients had GO, whereas 268 patients did not. Methods: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the HLA-A and HLA-C loci were genotyped. Main Outcome Measures: The Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test with Bonferroni correction were used. The odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by applying unconditional logistic regression with a 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Strong gender effects on the distribution of the SNPs were apparent: male GD patients carrying an A allele at rs2074503 in the PRR3 gene tended to avoid demonstrating GO (P = 0.008; OR, 0.450; 95% CI, 0.248-0.819), whereas female patients tended to show GO (P = 0.01; OR, 1.486; 95% CI, 1.098-2.012).

XIST is abnormally expressed in many sex-biased diseases. In addition, escape from XIST-mediated XCI and skewed XCI also contribute to sex-biased diseases. Therefore, its expression or modification can be regarded as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of many sex-biased diseases. Genetic manipulation of XIST expression can inhibit the progression of some of these diseases in animal models, and therefore XIST has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target.

J. and Livingston, D. H.",,,,,"Females have a longer lifespan and better general health than males. Considerable number of studies also demonstrated that, after trauma and sepsis, females present better outcomes as compared to males indicating sex-related differences in the innate immune response. The current notion is that differences in the immuno-modulatory effects of sex hormones are the underlying causative mechanism. However, the field remains controversial and the exclusive role of sex hormones has been challenged. Here, we propose that polymorphic X-linked immune competent genes, which are abundant in the population are important players in sex-based immuno-modulation and play a key role in causing sex-related outcome differences following trauma or sepsis. We describe the differences in X chromosome (ChrX) regulation between males and females and its consequences in the context of common X-linked polymorphisms at the individual as well as population level. We also discuss the potential pathophysiological and immune-modulatory aspects of ChrX cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females and how this may contribute to sex-biased immune-modulation. The potential confounding effects of ChrX skewing of cell progenitors at the bone marrow is also presented together with aspects of acute trauma-induced de novo ChrX skewing at the periphery. In support of the hypothesis, novel observations indicating ChrX skewing in a female trauma cohort as well as case studies depicting the temporal relationship between trauma-induced cellular skewing and the clinical course are also described. Finally, we list and discuss a selected set of polymorphic X-linked genes, which are frequent in the population and have key regulatory or metabolic functions in the innate immune response and, therefore, are primary candidates for mediating sex-biased immune responses. We conclude that sex-related differences in a variety of disease processes including the innate inflammatory response to injury and infection may be related to the abundance of X-linked polymorphic immune-competent genes, differences in ChrX regulation, and inheritance patterns between the sexes and the presence of X-linked cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females.","1664-3224 Spolarics, Zoltan Peña, Geber Qin, Yong Donnelly, Robert J Livingston, David H R01 GM118602/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Switzerland 2017/11/29 Front Immunol. 2017 Nov 13;8:1455. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01455. eCollection 2017. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.3389/fimmu.2017.01455,X chromosome inactivation;X chromosome skewing;cellular mosaicism;infection;injury;sepsis;sexual dimorphism;Tocopherols,,

Most human autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS) and autoimmune thyroid disease, have an increased incidence and prevalence in females, but a few others such as autoimmune diabetes, the Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) and psoriasis are increased in males. Animal models of autoimmunity show an equivalent sexual dimorphism. The possible reasons for the differing incidence and prevalence of autoimmune diseases in females and males engage our attention. Environmental exposures may differ for females and males. There are innate differences in the function of the female and male immune systems, and there is some evidence for differences between females and males in the ability of a target organ for autoimmunity to withstand damage. In seeking reasons for these differences, we review the role of sex hormones in immunity and include results of trials of hormone therapy in autoimmune diseases. The association of autoimmunity and pregnancy, a female-specific condition, is discussed, and the claimed effects of lymphoid cell microchimerism on provocation of autoimmunity are reviewed. Genetic predisposition is an important factor in autoimmune disease and we particularly focus on genes on the X and Y chromosomes, the role of X chromosome inactivation, and the interaction of the sex of the patient with other genetic factors. The possible role of epigenetic mechanisms, including environmental influences, is then surveyed.

Although the etiology and pathogenesis remain poorly understood in most cases, similarities between diseases outnumber differences in the initiation and perpetuation of the autoimmune injury. One major example is the predominance of affected women, and perhaps its most intriguing putative mechanism is related to sex chromosomes, based on the recent observation that women with autoimmune diseases manifest a higher rate of circulating leukocytes with a single X chromosome. In a complementary fashion, there have been several reports on a role of X chromosome gene dosage through inactivation or duplication in autoimmunity.

As with many autoimmune diseases, MG has a multifactorial etiology, resulting from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, as fully described in this review. Among environmental factors, viral infections could play a central role in autoimmunity, mainly through the induction of dysregulated Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated innate immune responses, which can lead to inflammation and adaptive autoimmune response.

The objective of this study was to evaluate evidence for causes of high F/M ratios of autoimmune and non-immunologic diseases. This was done by a literature review. Some thyroid, rheumatic and hepatic diseases consistently have high F/M ratios; other autoimmune diseases have low ratios. Because F/M ratios reflect disease incidence, not disease severity, an intrinsic biologic cause for the F/M ratios (such as estrogen) would be likely to act through a threshold or permissive mechanism rather than through quantitative immunomodulation. Sex differences related to environmental exposure, X-inactivation, imprinting, X or Y chromosome genes and intrauterine influences are other possible explanations for sex differences of incidence.

SLE incidence in female is substantially higher than males, but males tend to have more severe manifestations including greater risk of lupus nephritis (LN). Aberrant genetic expression of immune cells plays a vital role in pathogenesis of SLE and may explain gender diapariesties. We conducted bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SLE females and males with and without LN to identify gene differences and possible sex-tailored treatment. The gene expression profiling datasets (GSE 99967) were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo and analyzed by GEO2R platform. GSE 99967 used ffymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array and mRNA from whole blood. The t-test was done and adjusted P-value < 0.03 by Benjamini & Hochberg method was a threshold for statistically significant DEGs. 15 and 13 DEGs were obtained comparing SLE females with SLE males without and with LN, respectively. 13 common genes identified in both comparisons. XIST was the only down-regulated gene in male, located at X chromosome and responsible for initiation and spread of X-inactivation. X inactivation provides XIST dosage equivalence between genders. This suggested altered X-chromosome inactivation lead to female bias in SLE. Of 12 common up-regulated genes in male, 10 located at Y chromosome and showed a decrease up-regulated in SLE males with LN compare to without. A markly DEGs drop was found in TXLNGY, UTY and USP9Y, located at Yq 11.22. TXLNGY is a pseudo-gene so may not have roles in sex bias. UTY is a male-specific histone demethylase and USP9Y regulates level of protein turnover by preventing protein degradation including TGF-beta signaling. Change in UTY and USP9Y expression may associate with developing LN and drugs modifying their expression might benefit in treatment or prevention of LN in SLE males. The study enhanced an understanding of SLE sexual bias. Aberrant XIST inactivation may cause different incidence of SLE among gender. Drugs changing XIST expression might cure SLE. Change in UTY and USP9Y expression may relate to LN in male and drugs altering their expression might help in LN treatment and prevention.","L2005716731 2020-05-07 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: relevant,autoimmune",10.1053/j.ajkd.2020.02.364,endogenous compound;histone demethylase;messenger RNA;adult;bioinformatics;conference abstract;controlled study;female;gender;gene expression profiling;human;human cell;incidence;lupus erythematosus nephritis;male;prevention;protein degradation;protein expression;pseudogene;TGF beta signaling;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;Gene Expression;Computational Biology,,

Many explanations have been proposed, including sex hormones, the X chromosome, microchimerism, environmental factors, and the microbiome. However, the mechanism for this autoimmune sex bias remains obscure. In this manuscript, we evaluate the hypothesis that qualitative or quantitative differences in circulating antibodies may explain, at least in part, the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and its sex bias-especially when considering an evolutionary perspective. Indeed, women have higher absolute levels of antibodies than men, and (auto)antibodies are also associated with most autoimmune diseases. Several facts suggest differences in antibodies may cause increased prevalence of autoimmune disease in women. First, the association between increased quantities of serum antibodies and increased prevalence of autoimmunity is found not only in women, but also in men with Klinefelter syndrome. Second, both serum antibody levels and autoimmunity spike in the postpartum period. Third, a dose-response effect exists between parity and both serum antibodies and prevalence of autoimmune disease. Fourth, many biologically plausible mechanisms explain the association, such as T cell-dependent activation of B cells and/or VGLL3. The evolutionary underpinning of increased antibodies in women is likely to be protection of offspring from infections. Overall, this evolutionary paradigm can help explain why the phenomenon of autoimmunity occurs preferentially in women and raises the possibility of new treatment options.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 8 Total Times Cited: 9 Cited Reference Count: 62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: relevant,autoimmune",10.1111/eva.13167,autoantibody;autoimmune;evolution;gender;immunoglobulin;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;SEX-DIFFERENCES;KLINEFELTERS-SYNDROME;RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS;GENDER-DIFFERENCES;GUT MICROBIOME;CD40 LIGAND;EXPRESSION;RISK;AUTOANTIBODIES;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity,,

Indeed, it is well established in several experimental settings that the human immune system exhibits sexual dimorphism with basic immune responses differing between females and males. Among candidate factors to explain these differences we note that particular attention has been primarily devoted to sex hormones, yet data have been inconclusive or have not been confirmed. The same seems to apply to the hypothesis of fetal microchimerism. Most recently, sex chromosome abnormalities and skewed X chromosome inactivation have been suggested as novel players, particularly in later-onset diseases.

It is generally believed that the female advantage is associated with the effects of sex hormones. This review argues that the sex benefit of females during the host response is associated with polymorphism of X-linked genes and cellular mosaicism for X-linked parental alleles. Cells from females carry both parental X chromosomes (maternal, Xm; or paternal, Xp), whereas males carry only one (Xm). Because of dosage compensation and random X inactivation, half of the cells from females express either Xm or Xp. Therefore, females are cellular mosaics for their X-linked polymorphic genes. This cellular mosaicism in females represents a more adaptive and balanced cellular machinery that is advantageous during the innate immune response. Several genes encoding key metabolic and regulatory proteins reside on the X chromosome, including members of the apoptotic cascade, hormone homeostasis, glucose metabolic enzymes, superoxide-producing machinery, and the toll-like receptor/nuclear factor κB/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway. Polymorphic forms of these X-linked proteins are likely to manifest in phenotypic differences in the mosaic cell populations in females and may contribute to sex-related differences in the host response to injury and infection. The unique inheritance pattern of X-linked polymorphisms and their potential confounding effects in clinical trials are also discussed; furthermore, we present potential biomarkers for studying mosaic cell populations of innate immunity. ©2007The Shock Society.","L46788157 2007-06-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1097/SHK.0b013e31802e40bd,DNA;immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein;stress activated protein kinase;toll like receptor;apoptosis;cell population;chromosome mosaicism;DNA polymorphism;gene expression;gene frequency;genetic trait;glucose metabolism;heritability;heterozygosity;human;immune response;inflammatory disease;innate immunity;metabolic regulation;phenotypic plasticity;phenotypic variation;review;septic shock;sex difference;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Inflammation,,

In this review, we describe the advantages and limitations of genetic methodologies, and how these methods have been used to discover candidate genes in smaller populations of pediatric patients. We also introduce novel concepts for nontraditional modes of genetic inheritance that may be important in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Recent findings Candidate genes identified by linkage analyses and genome-wide association scans in adult populations have led to focused genetic studies in pediatric populations. Some genes are associated with subsets of both adult and pediatric patients; others appear to be age specific. Novel concepts in genetics have uncovered potential contributions of maternal compared with paternal transmission, noninherited maternal alleles that may work through maternal microchimerism, and sex-specific epigenetic mechanisms of immunoregulation. Summary Advancing methods are leading to the discovery of genes associated with childhood autoimmune diseases. However, the genetic contribution to disease risk for any one gene remains less than 30% for most diseases, suggesting that pediatric autoimmunity is not primarily genetic in a classical sense. A combinatorial approach considering the contributions of multiple genes, mode of inheritance, and environmental influences will be required to fully understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis in pediatric autoimmune disease.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 2 Total Times Cited: 2 Cited Reference Count: 59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1097/BOR.0b013e328307f283,autoimmune;genetics;juvenile dermatomyositis;Kawasaki disease;pediatric;systemic lupus erythematosus;SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS;NONINHERITED MATERNAL ANTIGENS;RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS;FUNCTIONAL POLYMORPHISM;KAWASAKI-DISEASE;X-INACTIVATION;HLA ALLELES;ASSOCIATION;ONSET;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity,,

T. and Koelsch, K. A. and Scofield, R. H.",,,,,"Background:CXorf21 and SLC15a4 both contain risk alleles for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). The former escapes X inactivation. Our group predicts specific endolysosomal-dependent immune responses are driven by the protein products of these genes, which form a complex at the endolysosomal surface. Our previous studies have shown that knocking out CXorf21 increases lysosomal pH in female monocytes, and the present study assesses whether the lysosomal pH in 46,XX women, who overexpress CXorf21 in monocytes, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs), differs from 46,XY men. Methods: To determine endolysosome compartment pH we used both LysoSensor™ Yellow/Blue DND-160 and pHrodo® Red AM Intracellular pH Indicator in primary monocyte, B cells, DCs, NK cells, and T cells from healthy men and women volunteers. Results: Compared to male samples, female monocytes, B cells, and DCs had lower endolysosomal pH (female/male pH value: monocytes 4.9/5.6 p < 0.0001; DCs 4.9/5.7 p = 0.044; B cells 5.0/5.6 p < 0.05). Interestingly, T cells and NK cells, which both express low levels of CXorf21, showed no differential pH levels between men and women. Conclusion: We have previously shown that subjects with two or more X-chromosomes have increased CXorf21 expression in specific primary immune cells. Moreover, knockdown of CXorf21 increases lysosomal pH in female monocytes. The present data show that female monocytes, DC, B cells, where CXorf21 is robustly expressed, have lower lysosomal pH compared to the same immune cell populations from males. The lower pH levels observed in specific female immune cells provide a function to these SLE/SS-associated genes and a mechanism for the reported inflated endolysosomal-dependent immune response observed in women compared to men (i.e., TLR7/type I Interferon activity).","1664-3224 Harris, Valerie M Harley, Isaac T W Kurien, Biji T Koelsch, Kristi A Scofield, Robert Hal U54 GM104938/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States U19 AI082714/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States P30 AR053483/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States P30 AR073750/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States T32 AR007534/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States I01 BX001451/BX/BLRD VA/United States R01 AR053734/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

Because F/M ratios reflect incidence and not severity of disease, gonadal hormones, if they play a role, must do so through a threshold or permissive mechanism.

SLE is one of many autoimmune disorders that have a strong gender bias, with 70-90% of SLE patients being female. Several explanations have been postulated to account for the severity of autoimmune diseases in females, including hormonal, microbiota, and gene dosage differences. X-linked toll-like receptors (TLRs) have recently been implicated in disease progression in females. Our previous studies using the 564Igi mouse model of SLE on a Tlr7 and Tlr9 double knockout background showed that the presence of Tlr8 on both X chromosomes was required for the production of IgG autoantibodies, Ifn-I expression and granulopoiesis in females. Here, we show the results of our investigation into the role of Tlr8 expression in SLE pathogenesis in 564Igi females. Female mice have an increase in serum pathogenic anti-RNA IgG2a and IgG2b autoantibodies. 564Igi mice have also been shown to have an increase in neutrophils in vivo, which are major contributors to Ifn-α expression. Here, we show that neutrophils from C57BL/6 mice express Ifn-α in response to 564 immune complexes and TLR8 activation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from 564Igi females have a significant increase in Tlr8 expression compared to male-derived cells, and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization data suggest that Tlr8 may escape X-inactivation in female-derived macrophages.

The work outlines some essential concepts regarding chrX inactivation, escape from chrX inactivation and the evolutionary history of chrX. In addition, we will discuss the concept of gene escape in immune cells, with examples related to specific X-linked genes and autoimmune diseases. Expert opinion There is growing evidence that many genes present on chrX escape inactivation, and some of them have significant immune-mediated functions. In immune cells of female individuals the escape of these genes is not constant, but the knowledge of the mechanisms controlling this plasticity are not completely understood. Future studies aimed at the characterization of these modifications at single-cell resolution, together with conformational 3D studies of the inactive X chromosome, will hopefully help to fill this gap of knowledge.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 0 Total Times Cited: 0 Cited Reference Count: 100 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: relevant,autoimmune",10.1080/1744666x.2022.2060203,Autoimmune diseases;autoimmunity;escape from X-chromosome inactivation;mammalian evolution;sex bias;sex chromosomes;X-chromosome inactivation;CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;FEMALE PREDOMINANCE;SEX-DIFFERENCES;T-CELLS;DISEASE;GENDER;WOMEN;EPIDEMIOLOGY;MECHANISMS;MONOSOMY,,

In women there is no substantive evidence to suggest that SLE reduces fertility, but subfertility may occur as a result of active disease, immunosuppressive drugs, and age-related declines in fertility related to delays in childbearing. Although pregnancy outcomes have improved, SLE still poses risks in pregnancy that contribute to poorer maternal and fetal outcomes. Cyclophosphamide, an important agent for the treatment of severe or life-threatening lupus, may adversely affect fertility, particularly with increases in dose and patient age. Fertility preservation techniques are therefore an important consideration for women and men before cytotoxic treatment. There is mixed evidence as to whether exogenous estrogen in the form of oral contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy may increase the risk for the development of SLE, but among women with SLE already diagnosed, combined oral contraceptive pills and hormone replacement therapy do not confer risk for severe flare and remain important in reproductive care. The higher incidence of SLE in women may nonetheless be attributable to effects of endogenous estrogen, as well as failures in X chromosome inactivation, increased Toll-like receptor gene products, and changes in microRNA function. A greater appreciation of the biological underpinnings and consequences of sex differences in SLE may lead to more targeted treatments and improved outcomes for patients with SLE.","L2004693799 2020-01-31 2020-02-03 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1016/j.mayocp.2019.09.012,"intrauterine contraceptive device;anticoagulant agent;cyclophosphamide;estrogen;immunosuppressive agent;levonorgestrel;microRNA;oral contraceptive agent;progesterone;sex hormone;toll like receptor;triptorelin;Human papilloma virus vaccine;azoospermia;chromosome inactivation;contraception;cryopreservation;cytotoxicity;deterioration;disease course;disease exacerbation;disease risk assessment;female fertility;fertility preservation;fetus outcome;gene function;gene product;high risk pregnancy;hormone substitution;human;incidence;Klinefelter syndrome;life threat;male fertility;onset age;pathogenesis;pregnancy;pregnancy outcome;review;sex chromosome;sex difference;subfertility;systemic lupus erythematosus;vaccination;Sex Characteristics;Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic",,

In this review, we consider gender differences in systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases, and we summarize human data that outlines the prevalence of common autoimmune diseases specific to adult males and females in countries commonly surveyed. We discuss possible mechanisms for sex specific differences including gender differences in immune response and organ vulnerability, reproductive capacity including pregnancy, sex hormones, genetic predisposition, parental inheritance, and epigenetics. Evidence demonstrates that gender has a significant influence on the development of autoimmune disease. Thus, considerations of gender should be at the forefront of all studies that attempt to define mechanisms that underpin autoimmune disease.

Hormonal status, genetic and epigenetic differences, and lifestyle have been considered in order to explain female preponderance in systemic sclerosis. Sex chromosomes play a determinant role in contributing to systemic sclerosis onset and progression, as well as in its sex-biased prevalence. It is known, in fact, that X chromosome contains many sex- and immuno-related genes, thus contributing to immuno tolerance and sex hormone status. This review focuses mainly on the recent progress on epigenetic mechanisms-exclusively linked to the X chromosome-which would contribute to the development of systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, we report also some hypotheses (dealing with skewed X chromosome inactivation, X gene reactivation, acquired monosomy) that have been proposed in order to justify the female preponderance in autoimmune diseases.

What role the X chromosome plays in the disease has always been an intriguing question. In this study, we examined the genetic variants on the X chromosome through meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on SLE on Chinese Han populations. Prominent association signals from the meta-analysis were replicated in 4 additional Asian cohorts, with a total of 5373 cases and 9166 matched controls. We identified a novel variant in PRPS2 on Xp22.3 as associated with SLE with genome-wide significance (rs7062536, OR = 0.84, P = 1.00E-08). Association of the L1CAM-MECP2 region with SLE was reported previously. In this study, we identified independent contributors in this region in NAA10 (rs2071128, OR = 0.81, P = 2.19E-13) and TMEM187 (rs17422, OR = 0.75, P = 1.47E-15), in addition to replicating the association from IRAK1-MECP2 region (rs1059702, OR = 0.71, P = 2.40E-18) in Asian cohorts. The X-linked susceptibility variants showed higher effect size in males than that in females, similar to results from a genome-wide survey of associated SNPs on the autosomes. These results suggest that susceptibility genes identified on the X chromosome, while contributing to disease predisposition, might not contribute significantly to the female predominance of this prototype autoimmune disease.","L602194945 2015-02-19 2015-02-24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1093/hmg/ddu429,"interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1;methyl CpG binding protein 2;article;autosome;correlation analysis;female;gene;gene frequency;gene linkage disequilibrium;gene replication;genetic association;genetic identification;genetic risk;genetic susceptibility;genetic variability;genotype;Han Chinese;human;immunopathogenesis;l1cam gene;male;naa10 gene;priority journal;promoter region;prps2 gene;sex difference;single nucleotide polymorphism;systemic lupus erythematosus;tmem187 gene;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome;Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic",,

E. and MacGregor, A.",,,,,"The aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has both genetic and environmental origins. However, the relationship of these with each other and with RA disease is complicated as both genes and environment may be protective or render individuals susceptible. Diagnostic certainty and disease heterogeneity have posed serious hurdles for investigating RA. Patients with similar disease phenotypes may have different aetiologies and it may now be more appropriate to investigate genetic susceptibility with respect to disease process or characteristic immunopathology. Disease concordance studies have been a classical approach to estimating the upper threshold of the genetic contribution to RA and recent studies have approximately halved the much quoted figure of 32% reported by Lawrence for RA concordance in monozygotic twins. However, the interpretation of twin data has to be treated with caution as MZ twins can differ in terms of somatic rearrangement/mutation of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes, X chromosome inactivation in females, genomic imprinting and in utero immune relationship. Calculations based on heritability put the genetic component in RA much higher. HLA is an important genetic factor in RA and risk is thought to be associated with a consensus sequence of amino acids within the third hypervariable region of certain DRB1 alleles. It is now clear that HLA is not particularly associated with onset of synovitis but is more associated with progression and severity of the disease process. The HLA-DRB1*0401/0404 genotype is particularly associated with severe, erosive and seropositive RA. Clear differences in RA susceptibility exist between males and females and this may be attributed to hormonal status. Males have a higher threshold requirement for developing RA and this may explain why RA in males is more associated with HLA risk alleles. We have now reached a critical time for the investigation of RA aetio-pathology. Recent advances in molecular biology and automated microsatellite gene scanning technology are making it possible to map disease susceptibility genes over the whole genome in common disorders such as RA. This will require large numbers of well characterised multiplex affected families. It is anticipated that some of the genes identified will fit in with our current concepts of which inflammatory and immune processes are pathologically important in RA. However others may be a major surprise.","Ollier, W E MacGregor, A Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review England 1995/04/01 Br Med Bull. 1995 Apr;51(2):267-85. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a072960. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a072960,"Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*genetics;Diseases in Twins;Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Female;Gene Rearrangement;Genetic Heterogeneity;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;HLA Antigens/genetics;Humans;Male;Sex Factors;Twin Studies as Topic;Molecular Epidemiology",,

In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial. Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses. We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs, monocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men. Female B cells where TLR7 is thus biallelically expressed display higher TLR7-driven functional responses, connecting the presence of two X chromosomes with the enhanced immunity of women and their increased susceptibility to TLR7-dependent autoimmune syndromes.","L624184692 2018-10-11 2019-02-19 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1007/s00281-018-0712-y,CD40 ligand;chemokine receptor CXCR3;estradiol;estrogen;estrogen receptor alpha;messenger RNA;toll like receptor 7;toll like receptor 8;transcription factor FOXP3;antibody production;autoimmune disease;B lymphocyte;cytokine production;disease predisposition;female;gene dosage;genetic risk;genetic susceptibility;human;immune evasion;Klinefelter syndrome;monocyte;nonhuman;pathogenesis;plasmacytoid dendritic cell;priority journal;review;sex difference;systemic lupus erythematosus;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome;Gene Dosage,,

Autoimmune attacks on self tissues can occur in any organ or body system. A notable feature of autoimmune disease is that a majority of these disorders occur predominantly in females. The precise basis of sex bias in autoimmune diseases is complex and potentially involves sex chromosomes, sex hormones, and sex-specific gene regulation in response to internal and external stimuli. Epigenetic regulation of genes, especially by microRNAs (miRNAs), is now attracting significant attention. miRNAs are small, non-protein-coding RNAs that are predicted to regulate a majority of human genes, including those involved in immune regulation. Therefore, it is not surprising that dysregulated miRNAs are evident in many diseases, including autoimmune diseases. Because there are marked sex differences in the incidence of autoimmune diseases, this review focuses on the role of sex factors on miRNA expression in the context of autoimmune diseases, an aspect not addressed thus far. Here, we initially review miRNA biogenesis and miRNA regulation of immunity and autoimmunity. We then summarize the recent findings of sexual dimorphism of miRNA expression in diverse tissues, which imply a critical role of miRNA in sex differentiation and in sex-specific regulation of tissue development and/or function. We also discuss the important contribution of the X chromosome and sex hormones to the sexual dimorphism of miRNA expression. Understanding sexually dimorphic miRNA expression in sex-biased autoimmune diseases not only offers us new insight into the mechanism of sex bias of the disease but will also aid us in developing new sex-based therapeutic strategies for the efficient treatment of these diseases with a sex bias. © 2014 Dai and Ahmed.","L372662228 2014-04-01 2014-04-09 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.2147/tcrm.S33517,androgen;argonaute 2 protein;CD40 ligand;cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B;cytochrome P450 2B9;dicer;DNA directed RNA polymerase III;estrogen;estrogen receptor alpha;exportin 5;interleukin 10;microRNA;microRNA 127;microRNA 155;microRNA 182;microRNA 221;microRNA 222;microRNA 223;microRNA 23a;microRNA 31;microRNA 379;microRNA 98;ribonuclease III;RNA polymerase II;RNase III enzyme Drosha;single stranded RNA;toll like receptor 7;unclassified drug;X chromosome linked microRNA;X linked inhibitor of apoptosis;3' untranslated region;autoimmune disease;autoimmunity;biogenesis;cause of death;CD4+ T lymphocyte;cellular distribution;disease predisposition;disease severity;epigenetics;gender bias;gene;gene expression;gene expression regulation;gene function;gene location;gene targeting;genetic predisposition;genetic transcription;gonad development;gonad function;hormonal regulation;human;immune response;immunocompetent cell;immunological tolerance;immunoregulation;mirtron;molecular recognition;nonhuman;pathophysiology;regulatory T lymphocyte;review;RNA structure;sex determination;sex difference;sex differentiation;sex ratio;signal transduction;systemic lupus erythematosus;tissue distribution;X chromosome inactivation;XIAP gene;Y chromosome;Autoimmune Diseases;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Intensive debates focus primarily on the role of sex hormones and genetic factors. Genetic factors may have impact on differences between genders in SLE through multiple mechanisms. The following mechanisms are discused - microchimerism, intrauterine selection hypothesis, skewed inactivation of X chromosome, X chromosome polysomy, reactivation of genes on inactive X chromosome, haploinsufficiency of genes on X chromosome, abnormal DNA methylation in lymphocytes, micro RNA encoded by X-linked genes.

The mechanisms behind this predominance are still to be elucidated, although multiple theories have been postulated and investigated. Among the proposed involved factors, sex hormones have been the first to be studied, but unfortunately data have been inconclusive or conflicting. Similarly, fetal microchimerism has received a huge attention in the past, but data in PBC have been unsatisfactory especially if compared to other autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus. Studies focused on genetic factors have generated more intriguing and robust data, reporting a few abnormalities on the X chromosome in PBC patients. However, these data are able to explain only a part of the phenotypic variability attributed to the genetic component, and most importantly, need to be validated in larger series. More recently, a novel mice model of PBC, characterised by a constitutive expression of Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), has been developed and it is notable for being the first one with female predominance. At the same time, there has been a wide interest in the role of microbiome in health and disease, as well as in epigenetics, which have tried to explain differences in biological phenotypes not covered by genetics. The aim of this review is to outline established knowledge on the topic and try to provide novel perspectives on the potential future applications of newer techniques addressing microbiome and epigenome, in order to further understand the biology of sex divergence in PBC.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 15 Total Times Cited: 18 Cited Reference Count: 112 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1016/j.jaut.2018.10.015,Primary biliary cholangitis;Female preponderance;Autoimmunity;Sex chromosomes;Epigenetics;ARE Del(-/-) mice;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION;ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR-BETA;HUMAN-LEUKOCYTE ANTIGEN;REGULATORY T-CELLS;SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI;SEX-DIFFERENCES;FETAL MICROCHIMERISM;AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE;GENE-EXPRESSION;Cholangitis,,

Approximately 90% of patients are female. We have produced data an X-chromosome gene dose effect increases susceptibility. Therefore, our objective is to functionally describe an X-linked protein which escapes X-inactivation, Chromosome X open reading frame 21 (CXorf21), to uncover any role this protein may have in the pathogenesis or susceptibility to SLE. Publicly available data predict CXorf21 is a dehydrogenase/reductase expressed almost exclusively in monocytes, B cells, and and other antigen-presenting cells. Additional studies show that CXorf21, a SLE risk allele, directly interacts with another SS/SLE-associated risk allele, Slc15a4. SLC15a4, a lysosomal proton-oligopeptide co-transporter, is necessary for endolysosomal antigen processing, TLR7- and NOD1-mediated cytokine as well as antibody production in dendritic cells and B cells. Methods: We used quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot protein analysis, Bio-plex cytokine immunoassay, and pHrodoTM assay, as well as, in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments to examine the role of CXorf21 in monocytes and B cell immunity. Results: Our data show that CXorf21 basal gene and protein expression is elevated in female primary monocytes and B cells compared to male cells. We also found CXorf21 mRNA expression was higher in both male and female SLE-affected EBV-transformed B cells and female primary Sjogren's Syndrome patient's PBMC subsets compared to healthy male controls. Additionally, we found that following activation by TLR7 (Imiquimod) and NOD1 (iE-DAP) agonists CXorf21, IFN-alpha, and NFkappaB expression increases, in addition to an increase IL-6 and TNF-αlpha cytokine production. This response is exaggerated in a female-specific manner. Successful knockdown of CXorf21, using CXorf21-specific gRNA (CRISPR-Cas9), abrogated both the expression levels and cytokine response in the female samples, but had not affect in male subjects. pHrodoTM lysosomal pH experiments revealed that knockdown of CXorf21 protein in healthy female monocytes resulted in an increased lysosomal pH. As result of the increase from acidic to a more alkaline lysosomal environment in the female samples (auto)antigen processing is perceived to be disrupted. Conclusion: CXorf21 is over-expressed in female immune cells compared to male cells and is involved in a sex-dependent dimorphic response to activation through TLR7 and NOD1. We propose that CXorf21 via interaction with the lysosome proton cotransporter, SLC15a4, maintains the lysosomal pH gradient necessary for monocyte and B cell immune response. Thus, sexual dimorphic expression of CXorf21, based on escape of X chromosome inactivation, skews (auto)antigen processing and immune response by women compared to men. CXorf21 may be a major contributor to TLR7 disease pathogenesis, and sex bias of the diseases based on an X chromosome dosage effect.","L626434527 2019-02-26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1002/art.40700,alpha interferon;autoantigen;caspase recruitment domain protein 4;cotransporter;endogenous compound;imiquimod;immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein;interleukin 6;messenger RNA;oligopeptide;oxidoreductase;proton;toll like receptor 7;tumor necrosis factor;adult;agonist;allele;antibody production;antigen presentation;conference abstract;controlled study;CRISPR-CAS9 system;cytokine production;cytokine response;dendritic cell;enzyme activity;female;gene overexpression;genetic association;genetic susceptibility;human;human cell;humoral immunity;immunoassay;immunocompetent cell;in vitro study;lysosome;male;monocyte;open reading frame;peripheral blood mononuclear cell;protein expression;protein function;quantitative analysis;real time polymerase chain reaction;Sjoegren syndrome;systemic lupus erythematosus;Western blotting;X chromosome inactivation;Bias (Epidemiology),,

H. and Hegedüs, L.",,,,,"By means of large twin cohorts, it has been possible to provide relatively valid and unbiased data regarding the influence of genetic and to some extent epigenetic factors in the aetiology of thyroid autoimmunity. The comparison of concordance rates between monozygotic and dizygotic twins provides irrefutable evidence of a genetic component in the aetiology of both Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, as well as for harbouring thyroid autoantibodies. Biometric modelling shows that approximately 75% of the total phenotypic variance in autoimmune thyroid disease is due to genetic effects. Despite the well known gender difference in the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease, the analyzes suggest that it is the same set of genes that operate in males and females. The lack of complete phenotypic concordance in monozygotic twin pairs indicates that also environmental and/or epigenetic factors are of importance. The impact of specific environmental and epigenetic exposures can be evaluated by investigating disease discordant twin pairs. Our studies show that skewed X chromosome inactivation is associated with clinically overt AITD but not with the presence of TPOAb in euthyroid individuals. It is now recognized that twin studies offer several features that uniquely enhance our ability to localize genes and understand their function. Future twin studies will incorporate information on genetic and epigenetic variation making it possible to quantify the precise effect of specific susceptibility genes and/or epigenetic variation on estimates of heritability.","2213-3941 Brix, T H Hegedüs, L Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review France 2011/04/23 Ann Endocrinol (Paris). 2011 Apr;72(2):103-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ando.2011.03.013.

There is a need to continue examining neuro-immune-endocrine crosstalk in the context of sexual dimorphisms in chronic pain. Several phenomena in particular need to be further explored. In patients, autoantibodies to neural antigens have been associated with sensory pathway hyper-excitability, and the role of self-antigens released by damaged nerves remains to be defined. In addition, specific immune cells release pro-nociceptive cytokines that directly influence neural firing, while T lymphocytes activated by specific antigens secrete factors that either support nerve repair or exacerbate the damage. Modulating specific immune cell populations could therefore be a means to promote nerve recovery, with sex-specific outcomes. Understanding biological sex differences that maintain, or fail to maintain, neuroimmune homeostasis may inform the selection of sex-specific treatment regimens, improving chronic pain management by rebalancing neuroimmune feedback. Given the significance of interactions between nerves and immune cells in the generation and maintenance of neuropathic pain, this review focuses on sex differences and possible links with persistent autoimmune activity using sciatica as an example.","2042-6410 Linher-Melville, Katja Shah, Anita Singh, Gurmit Orcid: 0000-0002-6256-5790 CAPMC/CIHR/Canada Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review England 2020/11/14 Biol Sex Differ. 2020 Nov 12;11(1):62. doi: 10.1186/s13293-020-00339-y. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune,chronic pain",10.1186/s13293-020-00339-y,Animals;*Autoimmunity;Chronic Pain/genetics/*immunology;Gonadal Steroid Hormones/physiology;Humans;*Neuroimmunomodulation;Sciatica/genetics/*immunology;*Sex Characteristics;Sex Chromosomes/genetics;Autoimmune;Chronic pain;Gonadal hormone;Immune system;Nociceptor;Sex difference;X chromosome inactivation;Sciatic Nerve;Sex Characteristics;Neuralgia,,

Both genetic and hormonal factors are involved in this phenomenon. The relation between puberty and F: M ratio in CAT has never been evaluated. Methods: The F: M ratio of 133 children with CAT (group A, age at diagnosis 2.4-17.7 years) was compared with that of 113 adult CAT patients (group B, age at diagnosis 21-79 years). Group A included 64 prepubertal (aged 2.4-13.2 years, group A1) and 69 pubertal (aged 9.2-17.4, group A2) children. Results: The F: M ratio in group A was 3.0, which is significantly (p < 0.001) lower than that (10.3) found in group B patients. The F: M ratio of group A1 prepubertal children was lower (1.6) and significantly different from that of pubertal (6.7, p < 0.01) and adult patients (10.3, p < 0.0001). This phenomenon was more evident in hypothyroid as compared to euthyroid CAT. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that female predominance of CAT strongly increases during puberty, suggesting a major role for sex hormones in this phenomenon. Further studies are needed to clarify this point. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

This higher IFNα production in females has been suggested to contribute to sex-specific differences in the manifestations of infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE). Factors underlying these sex dimorphisms in immunity include genetics, sex hormones and exposure to environmental factors. Genetic differences between women and men are mainly due to a different distribution of chromosomes, with females possessing two X chromosomes. TLR7 escapes X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in some female pDCs, leading to biallelic expression of TLR7 in those cells. The functional consequences of TLR7 escape from XCI in pDCs remain unknown. Question: The aim of this project was to investigate on the single cell level whether pDCs with escape from XCI in TLR7 have a superior capacity of transcribing IFNα mRNA. Methods: Healthy female donors were typed for heterozygosity of the TLR7 SNP rs3853839. Freshly isolated PBMCs of heterozygous females were collected and stimulated with the TLR7/8 agonist CL097. Subsequently pDCs were isolated via FACS and cDNA of single pDCs was obtained using the Fluidigm C1 technology. The expression of mRNA with or without the SNP enabled determination of mono- or biallelic expression pattern of TLR7 within the single pDC. In the same pDCs, mRNA expression levels of TLR7, IFNα subtypes and other genes were assessed via qPCR. Results and Conclusion: Studies in three females heterozygous for TLR7 SNP rs3853839 showed that 19 - 37% of pDCs display biallelic expression of TLR7, using data from 176 single cells. The levels of TLR7 mRNA were higher in cells with biallelic compared to monoallelic TLR7 expression. In addition, multiple IFNα mRNA subtypes were expressed at higher levels in pDCs with biallelic compared to monoallelic expression of TLR7 following CL097 stimulation. These data demonstrate that on the single cell level escape from XCI can contribute to stronger IFNα transcription by female pDCs.","L631551923 2020-04-28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune,infectious",10.1002/eji.201970300,alpha interferon;complementary DNA;endogenous compound;messenger RNA;toll like receptor 7;adult;allele;case report;cell level;clinical article;conference abstract;female;flow cytometry;genetic association;genetic difference;genetic transcription;heterozygosity;human;human cell;male;mRNA expression level;peripheral blood mononuclear cell;plasmacytoid dendritic cell;protein expression;single nucleotide polymorphism;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;X Chromosome,,

The majority of autoimmune diseases occur more commonly in females, although some are more frequent in males, while others show no bias by sex. The mechanisms leading to sex biased disease prevalence are not well understood. However, for adult-onset autoimmune disease, at least some of the cause is usually ascribed to sex hormones. This is because levels of sex hormones are one of the most obvious physiological differences between adult males and females, and their impact on immune system function is well recognised. While for paediatric-onset autoimmune diseases a sex bias is not as common, there are several such diseases for which one sex predominates. For example, the oligoarticular subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) occurs in approximately three times more girls than boys, with a peak age of onset well before the onset of puberty, and at a time when levels of androgen and oestrogen are low and not strikingly different between the sexes.

Sequences on the inactive X may cause gene overexpression upon demethylation. X chromosome inactivation has been implicated in female predisposition to autoimmunity. Here we have investigated the epigenetic regulation of X chromosome miRNAs in CD4+ T cells to identify the effect of miRNA on gender bias in autoimmunity. Method: Methylation sensitive mRNA and miRNA from CD4+ T cells were identified by using experimentally demethylated in vitro system using DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azaC). Transcript profiling for isolated RNA was performed by using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Genome-wide qPCR miRNA expression profiling was performed using System Biosciences (SBI) QuantiMir™ RT Kit. Results from hypomethylated experiments were compared to expression profiles from active lupus patients to identify methylation sensitive genes differentially expressed in lupus patients. Most likely oppositely-correlated miRNA: RNA interactions were identified by RNA22 tool from IBM research. Results: When the differential expression between women and men were compared without T cell stimulation, 5-AzaC caused a total of 97 genes to differentially express between women and men of which 78 were female biased genes. However, PMA-ionomycin stimulation caused downregulation of 157 genes out of 170 differentially expressed genes in women. Using a factor of 2 fold as a cut-off, we identified a total of 104 miRNAs up-regulated in 5AzaC treated CD4+ T cells, of which 27 were female biased and 11 were male biased. The X chromosome encoded miRNAs; hsa-let-7f-2∗, hsa-miR-503, hsa-miR-421, hsa-miR-188-3p, hsa-miR-513-a- 3p and hsa-miR-374a were found to be expressed higher in women compared to men in when the DNA was hypomethylated. Furthermore hsa-let-7f-2∗, hsa-miR-503 and hsa-miR-188-3p were highly expressed in active female lupus patients tested (n =4) compared to the healthy controls. Functional Annotation clustering of these miRNA targets revealed that the genes belonging to “response to stress” category being most affected. Conclusion: These results suggest that the miRNA overexpression due to DNA demethylation may contribute to the downregulation of genes observed in hypomethylated CD4+T cells. Furthermore, the demethylation of X chromosome resulting in elevated levels of X chromosome miRNAs, may play a major role in the decreased mRNA levels in stimulated CD4+ T cells in women. This in turn may contribute to the gender differences of gene expression levels. Better understanding of the intertwined connection between epigenetics to miRNAs and gene expression could add a new dimension to the understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to gender bias in autoimmune diseases.","L70443556 2011-06-27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1177/09612033100190010101,CD4 antigen;microRNA;DNA;messenger RNA;RNA;DNA methyltransferase inhibitor;decitabine;ionomycin;human;T lymphocyte;X chromosome;blood;female;gene;patient;demethylation;methylation;gender bias;gene expression;autoimmunity;gene overexpression;X chromosome inactivation;disease predisposition;in vitro study;human genome;genome;cell stimulation;stimulation;male;epigenetics;autoimmune disease;sex difference;regulatory sequence;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;X Chromosome,,

The striking female predominance was initially attributed primarily to sex hormones. However, recent data challenge this simplistic view and point more towards genetic and epigenetic factors accounting for this difference. More specifically, several SLE-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to play an important role in the gender predilection in SLE. Their effect is mediated through their involvement in sex-hormone and immune system signalling and dysregulation of the expression of genes and miRNAs pertinent to the immune system. Additionally, the genetic factors are interchangeably associated with epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modification, thus revealing a highly complex network of responsible mechanisms. Of importance, disturbance in the epigenetic process of X chromosome inactivation in females as well as in rare X chromosome abnormalities leads to increased expression of X-linked immune-related genes and miRNAs, which might predispose females to SLE. Microbiota dysbiosis has also been implicated in the sexual dimorphism by the production of oestrogens within the gut and the regulation of oestrogen-responsive immune-related genes. Sexual dimorphism in SLE is an area of active research, and elucidation of its molecular basis may facilitate ongoing efforts towards personalized care.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 25 Total Times Cited: 26 Cited Reference Count: 50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1177/0961203318815768,Female predominance;lupus;genetic;epigenetic;microbiota;hormones;SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS;T-CELLS;GUT MICROBIOME;GENDER BIAS;GENES;WOMEN;INACTIVATION;PATHOGENESIS;ASSOCIATION;EXPRESSION;Gonadal Steroid Hormones,,

H.",,,,,"Most autoimmune diseases occur significantly more frequently in women than men. This female preponderance for abnormal autoimmune function has largely gone unexplained. Many investigations have concentrated on the effects of female and male sex hormones on immune function, by suggesting that estrogens favor the antibody production-enhancing Th2 response and, by doing so, possibly, increase the risk towards abnormal autoimmune function. Others have suggested that women are genetically predisposed towards abnormal autoimmune function, possibly because the X chromosome may confer susceptibility towards tolerance breakdown. Recent developments have, however, opened new research avenues. The possible association between persistent fetal-maternal microchimerism and the development of autoimmune diseases has attracted special interest. Since, in analogy to allogeneic organ transplantation, fetal-maternal (and maternal-fetal) microchimerism may play an important role in the immunologic tolerance of the fetal semi-allograft, female preponderance for autoimmune diseases may be understood as a consequence of increased allogeneic cell traffic in females (in comparison to males), increased risk for long-term microchimerism and, therefore, as a consequence of the former two, the development of abnormal autoimmunity. Under an evolutionary view point the occurrence of antoimmune diseases, in general, can be seen as the price to be paid for successful reproduction. In view of increased exposure to cell traffic, women, of course, would be expected to pay a higher price, reflected in more autoimmunity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that Xist RNA and heterochromatin modifications transiently reappear at the Xi and are missing in mature single positive T cells. Activation of mature T cells restores Xist RNA and heterochromatin marks simultaneously back to the Xi. Notably, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) maintenance is altered in T cells of SLE patients and late-stage-disease NZB/W F1 female mice, and we show that X-linked genes are abnormally upregulated in SLE patient T cells. SLE T cells also have altered expression of XIST RNA interactome genes, accounting for perturbations of Xi epigenetic features. Thus, abnormal XCI maintenance is a feature of SLE disease, and we propose that Xist RNA localization at the Xi could be an important factor for maintaining dosage compensation of X-linked genes in T cells.","2379-3708 Syrett, Camille M Paneru, Bam Sandoval-Heglund, Donavon Wang, Jianle Banerjee, Sarmistha Sindhava, Vishal Behrens, Edward M Atchison, Michael Anguera, Montserrat C T32 HD083185/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States R01 GM111384/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States T32 GM007229/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States F31 GM123604/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States R01 AI079002/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States K12 HD085848/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States R21 AI124084/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2019/04/05 JCI Insight. 2019 Apr 4;4(7):e126751. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.126751. eCollection 2019 Apr 4. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1172/jci.insight.126751,"Animals;Autoimmunity/*genetics;Child;Datasets as Topic;Disease Models, Animal;Female;Heterochromatin/genetics/metabolism;Histones/genetics/metabolism;Humans;Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/blood/*genetics/immunology;Lymphocyte Activation;Male;Mice;RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/metabolism;RNA-Seq;Sex Factors;Single-Cell Analysis;Spleen/cytology;T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism;T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism;X Chromosome/genetics/metabolism;X Chromosome Inactivation/*immunology;Autoimmunity;Cell Biology;Epigenetics;Noncoding RNAs;T cell development;Autoimmune Diseases",,

SLE prevalence is also elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of CD27+ plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold increase over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class switch during the TLR7-driven, T cell–dependent differentiation of naive B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. TLR7 escape from X inactivation endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands. This finding supports the hypothesis that enhanced TLR7 expression owing to biallelism contributes to the higher risk of developing SLE and other autoimmune disorders in women and in men with Klinefelter syndrome.","L2001689796 2019-03-20 2019-06-28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune,chromosomal",10.1126/sciimmunol.aap8855,CD27 antigen;immunoglobulin G;toll like receptor 7;allele;article;B lymphocyte;cell compartmentalization;cell proliferation;controlled study;dendritic cell;female;gene expression;gene product;human;human cell;immunocompetent cell;immunoglobulin class switching;Klinefelter syndrome;lymphocyte differentiation;monocyte;plasmacytoma cell line;priority journal;single cell analysis;T lymphocyte;TLR7 gene;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome,,

The diagnostic hallmark of PBC is the presence of disease-specific antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), which are pathognomonic for the development of PBC. The disease overwhelmingly affects females, with some cases of male PBC being reported. The reasons underlying the low incidence of males with PBC are largely unknown. Epidemiological studies estimate that approximately 7-11% of PBC patients are males. There does not appear to be any histological, serological, or biochemical differences between male and female PBC, although the symptomatology may differ, with males being at higher risk of life-threatening complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatoma. Studies on X chromosome and sex hormones are of interest when studying the low preponderance of PBC in males; however, these studies are far from conclusive. This paper will critically analyze the literature surrounding PBC in males.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 24 Total Times Cited: 26 Cited Reference Count: 147 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1155/2012/610504,"x-chromosome inactivation;regulatory t-cells;autoimmune liver-disease;human-leukocyte antigen;antimitochondrial antibodies;cross-reactivity;risk-factors;antinuclear antibodies;pyruvate-dehydrogenase;mitochondrial autoantigens;Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary;Sex Characteristics",,

The genetic basis for this sex-bias arises from the X chromosome. Female mammals, with two X chromosomes, utilize the epigenetic process of X Chromosome Inactivation (XCI), which transcriptionally silences one X. Expression of the long noncoding RNA Xist from the inactive X (Xi) reorganizes the Xi into a compact, bipartite structure, and targets the Xi to the nuclear periphery in somatic cells. The paradigm of XCI maintenance in somatic cells is stable association of Xist RNA and heterochromatic marks on the Xi, which function to maintain the Xi structure. Recently, we found a dynamic mechanism of XCI maintenance in female lymphocytes. In naïve female B cells, Xist RNA is not localized to the Xi, but after stimulation Xist RNA and heterochromatin marks return to the Xi. How this dynamic XCI process impacts Xi structure in lymphocytes is unknown, including which factors regulate Xi nuclear organization in this system. Using a novel allele-specific imaging system, we will present new findings on the compaction and organization of the Xi in lymphocytes. Additionally, we are investigating the regulatory roles of chromatin organization and nuclear structure proteins for lymphocyte-specific XCI maintenance, and how these factors regulate X-linked gene expression. Together, these results underscore the importance of Xi structure for the fidelity of XCI in female lymphocytes.","L633105387 2020-10-21 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",,endogenous compound;long untranslated RNA;adult;allele;B lymphocyte;chromatin structure;conference abstract;controlled study;female;heterochromatin;human;human cell;imaging system;protein expression;somatic cell;transcription initiation;X chromosome inactivation;Lymphocytes,,

Using single-cell and bulk-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we found that X-linked immunity genes escape XCI in specific healthy human B cell subsets and that human SLE B cells exhibit aberrant expression of X-linked genes and XIST RNA interactome genes. Our data reveal that mislocalized XIST RNA, coupled with a dramatic reduction in heterochromatic modifications at the Xi in SLE, predispose for aberrant X-linked gene expression from the Xi, thus defining a genetic and epigenetic pathway that affects X-linked gene expression in human SLE B cells and likely contributes to the female bias in SLE.","L2012940958 2021-06-15 2021-12-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1073/pnas.2024624118,adult;article;autoimmunity;B lymphocyte;B lymphocyte activation;bulk cell RNA sequencing;child;controlled study;epigenetics;female;fibroblast;fluorescence in situ hybridization;gene expression;genetic transcription;heterochromatin;human;human cell;immunofluorescence;in vitro study;memory cell;RNA sequencing;single cell RNA seq;single nucleotide polymorphism;systemic lupus erythematosus;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

The genetic basis for this bias is the Xchromosome, where the greatest concentration of immunity related genes on any chromosome can be found. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and through a process, known as X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), silence one of their X-chromosomes randomly to have a similar level of X-linked gene expression as males (XY). In XCI, XIST RNA, a long non-coding RNA, is expressed from the future inactive X (Xi) and is bound to it in cis by the transcription factor YY1. As XIST coats the Xi, it recruits heterochromatin modifiers to condense and silence it. Previous research has shown that human SLE patient B cells exhibit altered localization of XIST RNA, thus indicating that they have partial reactivation of the Xi. To explore this relationship, we worked with NZB/W F1mice, which are a well-characterized murine model of SLE that also displays a female bias. The hypothesis of our study is that due to reduced expression of YY1, NZB/W F1 mice have altered Xist RNA localization leading to increased expression of X-linked genes in splenic B cells. Preliminary results using qPCR indicate that the concentration of YY1 is reduced across all stages of disease in NZB/W F1 when compared to age-matched wild type (WT) mice. Using Xist RNA FISH, we have observed that the activated B cells of late stage disease NZB/W F1 mice have decreased localization of Xist RNA to the Xi when compared to WT. In addition, we observed that the expression of TLR7 and CXCR3, two x-linked genes, are increased in diseased NZB/W F1 when compared to age-matched WT.","L623263581 2018-08-02 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",,"chemokine receptor CXCR3;endogenous compound;long untranslated RNA;toll like receptor 7;transcription factor YY1;adult;animal cell;animal experiment;animal model;conference abstract;controlled study;female;heterochromatin;mouse;murine model;nonhuman;preliminary data;protein expression;real time polymerase chain reaction;splenic B cell;systemic lupus erythematosus;transcription initiation;wild type mouse;X chromosome inactivation;Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic;Bias (Epidemiology);RNA",,

The process of X chromosome inactivation regulated by lncRNA Xist is important for dose compensation of immune-related X-linked genes between the sexes. This study aimed to explore a Xist-related pathway which might lead to the female preponderance of NMOSD. Some studies have shown that lncRNA Xist may interact with transactive response DNA-binding protein (TARDBP, also known as TDP43). TDP43 can be cleaved by caspase-3 into its active form, TDP35, which might increase the level of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), while IRF3 may promote the proliferation of Th17 cells. Our preliminary study conducted in peripheral blood mononuclear cell of female NMOSD patients showed the same trend with above literatures. Based on those studies and our preliminary results, we hypothesized that in the CD4+ na??ve T cells of female NMOSD patients, the downregulation of lncRNA Xist decreased its interaction with TDP43 and released more TDP43 to be cleaved to its active form TDP35, thereby inhibits IRF3 degradation, and then promotes the differentiation and proliferation of Th17 cells and induced the inflammation of female NMOSD patients. This study would shed further light on the immune regulation mechanism related to lncRNA Xist, which may play a key role in the sex bias of NMOSD.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 0 Total Times Cited: 0 Cited Reference Count: 26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: autoimmune",10.1016/j.mehy.2022.110894,NMOSD;LncRNA Xist;TDP43;IRF3;T helper 17;TARGETS;Cell Differentiation,,

Epidemiologic studies have shifted from an exclusive focus on the identification of genetic risk alleles for such disorders to recognizing and understanding the contribution of xenobiotic exposures, infections, and the maternal immune system during the prenatal and early post-natal periods. In this review we discuss the growing literature regarding the effects of maternal brain-reactive antibodies on fetal brain development and their contribution to the development of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Autoimmune diseases primarily affect women and are more prevalent in mothers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, mothers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are significantly more likely to have an autoimmune disease than women of neurotypically developing children. Moreover, they are four to five times more likely to harbor brain-reactive antibodies than unselected women of childbearing age. Many of these women exhibit no apparent clinical consequence of harboring these antibodies, presumably because the antibodies never access brain tissue. Nevertheless, these maternal brain-reactive antibodies can access the fetal brain, and some may be capable of altering brain development when present during pregnancy. Several animal models have provided evidence that in utero exposure to maternal brain-reactive antibodies can permanently alter brain anatomy and cause persistent behavioral or cognitive phenotypes. Although this evidence supports a contribution of maternal brain-reactive antibodies to neurodevelopmental disorders, an interplay between antibodies, genetics, and other environmental factors is likely to determine the specific neurodevelopmental phenotypes and their severity. Additional modulating factors likely also include the microbiome, sex chromosomes, and gonadal hormones. These interactions may help to explain the sex-bias observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies on this topic provide a unique opportunity to learn how to identify and protect at risk pregnancies while also deciphering critical pathways in neurodevelopment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 11 Total Times Cited: 11 Cited Reference Count: 178 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: immune,autoimmune,neurological",10.3389/fimmu.2019.01129,brain-reactive antibodies;autism spectrum disorder;neurodevelopmental disorders;sex bias;gonadal hormones;sex chromosomes;microbiome;AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS;BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER;PARANEOPLASTIC NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS;SEX-CHROMOSOME COMPLEMENT;X-INACTIVATION PROFILE;GENE-EXPRESSION;GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR;GUT MICROBIOTA;FETAL-BRAIN;DEVELOPMENTAL-DISABILITIES;Animal Shells;Animals,,

One important biological factor underlying this sex bias is the X-chromosome, which is enriched for immunity-related genes. Female mammals use X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) to generate a transcriptionally silent inactive X-chromosome enriched with heterochromatic modifications and the long noncoding RNA Xist, which equalizes gene expression between the sexes. We have discovered that XCI is maintained differently in female lymphocytes from mice and humans, where Xist RNA and heterochromatic modifications dynamically associate with the inactive X-chromosome. Mature naïve B cells are missing Xist RNA and heterochromatin marks on the inactive X, and these marks return to most cells with in vitro stimulation. We found that the chromatin of the inactive X changes during early B cell commitment, at the pro-B cell stage, initiated by the loss of Xist RNA localization. In mature lymphocytes, we found evidence of biallelic expression and increased dosage of immunity-related X-linked genes including TLR7 and CXCR3, in support of relaxed transcriptional silence from the inactive X. During B cell activation, Xist RNA is relocalized to the inactive X by the transcription factor YY1, in a novel two-step process unique to B cells. YY1-mediated relocalization of Xist RNA during B cell stimulation is necessary for enrichment of heterochromatin modifications and maintenance of X-linked gene silencing. Furthermore, we examined lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disorder with a strong female bias, and observed mislocalized XIST RNA transcripts and evidence of biallelic expression of immunity-related genes from both X-chromosomes. We propose that the Xi in female lymphocytes is predisposed to become partially reactivated and to overexpress immunity-related genes, providing the first mechanistic evidence for the female-specific enhanced immune responses and increased susceptibility for autoimmunity.","L622545809 2018-06-18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: immune,autoimmune",,chemokine receptor CXCR3;endogenous compound;toll like receptor 7;transcription factor YY1;adult;allele;animal cell;animal experiment;autoimmunity;B lymphocyte activation;cell stimulation;conference abstract;controlled study;female;gene overexpression;gene silencing;genetic susceptibility;heterochromatin;immune response;in vitro study;mouse;nonhuman;pre B lymphocyte;protein expression;systemic lupus erythematosus;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome;Lymphocytes,,
