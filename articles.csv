Placental metabolic dysfunction is a common occurrence in preeclampsia although its causal relationship to the pathophysiology is unclear. At the outset, this may simply be seen as an ""engine out of fuel."" However, placental metabolism plays a vital role beyond energy production and is linked to physiological and developmental processes. In this review, we discuss the metabolic basis for placental dysfunction and propose that the alterations in energy metabolism may explain many of the placental phenotypes of preeclampsia such as reduced placental and fetal growth, redox imbalance, oxidative stress, altered epigenetic and gene expression profiles, and the functional consequences of these aberrations. We propose that placental metabolic reprogramming reflects the dynamic physiological state allowing the tissue to adapt to developmental changes and respond to preeclampsia stress, whereas the inability to reprogram placental metabolismmay result in severe preeclampsia phenotypes. Finally, we discuss common tested and novel therapeutic strategies for treating placental dysfunction in preeclampsia and their impact on placental energy metabolism as possible explanations into their potential benefits or harm.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 14 Total Times Cited: 14 Cited Reference Count: 141 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Maybe""}",10.1016/j.ajog.2020.11.005,epigenetics;fetal growth restriction;glycolysis;metabolism;metformin;mitochondria;placenta;preeclampsia;reactive oxygen species;MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX-III;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;CENTRAL CARBON METABOLISM;HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR;COMBINED VITAMIN-C;GENE-EXPRESSION;SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM;E SUPPLEMENTATION;MAMMALIAN TARGET;OXIDATIVE STRESS;Energy Metabolism;Pre-Eclampsia,,

XIST is a prototypical lncRNA involved in cis-silencing of an X chromosome in females; however, there are conflicting reports of lncRNA-mediated regulation in cancer biology and therapeutics through “sponging” of single miRNAs that cause upregulation of canonical miRNA-target genes. XIST-associated sex-specific differences afford the opportunity to study lncRNA sponging systems within a cancer type. Existing studies considering one miRNA in singular cancer types do not account for important biological considerations, including sex and localization of miRNA and XIST transcripts. Here, we detail an in-depth and unbiased pipeline for the discovery of candidate miRNA and gene targets in lncRNA sponging, and validate the miRNA that may be mediating these interactions in XIST. Method: We performed a comprehensive analysis of the role of XIST in the positive regulation of protein-coding genes using male and female lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples as a model. To find genes regulated by XIST-mediated miRNA sponging, we correlated all Ensembl-annotated genes with XIST expression in female LUAD (n=307; rho>0.4, p<0.05). Using a specialized algorithm based on binding energies and sequence homology, we assessed the potential binding of all miRNAs against target genes and XIST. We then determine the best candidates for sponging by XIST using XIST-high (female and male) and XIST-low (male) systems, and validate the presence of these candidate miRNAs in the nucleus. Result: Our analysis yielded 543 genes that may be defended from miRNAs by XIST (DMX), with a predicted 804 miRNAs targeting both DMX genes and XIST. We compared the changes in miRNA-DMX relationships in XIST-high and XIST-low systems and discovera high-confidence set of 13 miRNA-DMX gene pairs. Interestingly, 5 of these miRNA-DMX gene pairs involve miRNA with validated nuclear localization. Conclusion: A massive number of lncRNA sponging studies exist, but most only consider one miRNA in a singular type of cancer, are biased in their selection of this target, and limited in biological context. By analyzing the transcriptome of female and male LUAD, we show that the XIST-miRNA-DMX sponging axis is affected by expression of sex-specific genes and number of shared miRNA binding sites on DMX genes. Importantly, we identify that the miRNAs that mediate the XIST-DMX gene axis are enriched in the nucleus, co-localizing with XIST. In summary, our analysis provides both a comprehensive methodology for studying cancer-related miRNA sponge lncRNAs, and suggests the relevance of XIST in lung cancer.

Results: Gender is a well-known, independent factor influencing phenotypic expression, course and therapeutical response of many human pathologies, of both acquired and genetic origin. In the broad field of neuromuscular disorders we can encounter gender-specific diseases, mainly related to the X-chromosome abnormalities, and gender-influenced disorders, which are more common in one sex or have a different course in each sex. Moreover, we have to deal with other gender-specific issues, such as fertility, pregnancy and delivery complications in women with muscle disorders. Well-known examples of the first group are the X-linked muscular dystrophies and myopathies, such as dystrophinopathies, emerinopathies, and centronuclear myopathy. In the recessive disorders, males usually present a defined, more severe phenotype, whereas females carrying one mutated allele may show very different clinical pictures, mainly related to the variable X chromosome inactivation, thus complicating the diagnostic procedures. When evaluating a female with muscle symptoms, the possibility of a carrier status for an X-linked disease should always be ascertained. Among the gender-influenced diseases, inflammatory myopathies are more frequent in females, as observed also in the majority of autoimmune diseases; namely, polymyositis and dermatomyositis incidence is evidently higher in females, with a ratio of 2.5:1. On the contrary, inclusion body myositis (IBM), which has a peculiar degenerative component, prevales in middle-aged and older men. This is consistent with other neurodegenerative diseases, in which the female gender may have a 'protective' role, as observed in some experimental autophagic pathological processes. Other examples include FSHD, with a more favourable clinical course in females, and Pompe's disease, in which female gender seems to be related to a better therapeutical response. Finally, pregnancy may cause deterioration of the clinical course in women with muscular weakness of different origin, especially due to the additional physiological changes: a strict monitoring of the cardiac, respiratory and motor function is therefore always necessary, associated to a surveillance of possible metabolic derangements. Child delivery options are challenging in muscle disorders: a natural delivery is not indicated when respiratory, abdominal or pelvic muscle are involved, whereas a Caesarean section may be safely performed with a spinal anesthesia to avoid intubation even in more affected women. A strict follow up in expert Centers is recommendable in all cases. Conclusions: Gender differences in muscle diseases may have a more important role on outcomes and effects of therapies, such as observed in other medical disciplines. Gender-related variants in the pathogenetic processes, as well as in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, should always be addressed in the development of new therapeutical options.","L71564933 2014-08-21 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Maybe""}",10.1007/s00415-014-7337-4,muscle disease;neurology;gender;female;human;diseases;male;disease course;pregnancy;muscle;X chromosome;centronuclear myopathy;chromosome aberration;dystrophinopathy;neuromuscular disease;polymyositis;achievement;myopathy;dermatomyositis;inclusion body myositis;degenerative disease;phenotype;allele;X chromosome inactivation;muscular dystrophy;myositis;follow up;autoimmune disease;clinical practice;cesarean section;middle aged;X chromosome linked disorder;deterioration;muscle weakness;monitoring;motor performance;pelvis;natural childbirth;child;diagnostic procedure;fertility;spinal anesthesia;intubation;pathology;sex difference;therapy;pharmacokinetics;pharmacodynamics;glycogen storage disease type 2;Muscular Diseases,,

Familiarity and high concordance rates for the disease among monozygotic twins strongly support the role of genetics in the disease.

In humans 15-25% of X-linked genes have been shown to 'escape' from X-chromosome inactivation. A significant subset of X-linked escapees are likely important contributors to human phenotype by lack of dosage compensation. To date, little is known about genes that escape inactivation. Recent genomic studies have yielded contradictory results and fueled debate over the possibility that genomic imprinting is not limited to autosomes and the Xinactivation center. Methods: We report two females with intractable epilepsy caused by de novo loss of function variants in KIAA2022, an X-linked gene associated with severe intellectual disability in males. This is perplexing since the carrier mothers of such males are unaffected. Random patterns of Xchromosome inactivation have been observed in both affected females and unaffected carrier mothers so is not sufficient to explain these differences. Results: We review what is known about KIAA2022 and offer parent-of origin mono-allelic expression as a possible mechanism for the apparent dichotomous phenotypic expression of KIAA2022. Conclusions: The sex-specific dichotomous phenotypic expression of KIAA2022 presents us with a pathophysiological conundrum. We propose that parent-of-origin monoallelic expression within a given cell or tissue may account for this observation. This opens the door to a novel field of Xlinked intellectual disability research in females in which Xlinked genes escaping X-inactivation exhibit non-random monoallelic expression, contributing to an atypical mode of inheritance.",L612930966 2016-11-02,10.1002/pon.4272,endogenous compound;allele;autosome;case report;disease carrier;female;gene expression;gene inactivation;genetic predisposition;genetics;genome imprinting;human;intellectual impairment;intractable epilepsy;loss of function mutation;male;mother;organ culture;participant observation;X chromosome inactivation,,

Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are complex autoimmune disorder related by B cell hyperactivity resulting in autoantibody and cytokine production. Approximately 90% of patients are female. We have produced data showing an X-chromosome gene dose effect or simply the number of X chromosomes increases susceptibility. Therefore, our objective is to functionally describe the protein encoded by the gene Chromosome X open reading frame 21 (CXorf21), which escapes X inactivation and is a lupus risk gene, to uncover any role this protein may have in the pathogenesis or susceptibility to SS and SLE. Publically available data predict CXorf21 is a dehydrogenase/reductase expressed almost exclusively in B cells and myeloid lineage antigen-presenting cells. Additional studies show that CXorf21 directly interacts with another SS/SLE-associated risk allele, Slc15A4. SLC15a4, a pH-sensitive lysosomal proton-oligopeptide co-transporter; and, is necessary for lysosomal antigen processing, TLR7-and NOD1-mediated cytokine as well as antibody production in dendritic cells and B cells. Methods. We used quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot protein analysis, immunofluorescence, pHrodo™ and Lysosensor™ assays, as well as, in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments to examine the role of CXorf21 in monocytes and B cell immunity. Results. Our in vitro qPCR data confirm CXorf21 expression in CD19+ B cells and monocytes. Preliminary immunofluorescence studies show that CXorf21 is a cytosolic rather than nuclear protein. Our data show that CXorf21 basal gene and protein expression is elevated more than 1.5-fold in female primary monocytes compared to male cells. Additionally, we found that following a time-and concentration-dependent activation by TLR7 (Imiquimod [2μM]) or NOD1 (C12-iE-DAP [20μM]) agonists, resulted in TLR7 and CXorf21 expression increase 3-and 5-fold, respectively. Successful knockdown of CXorf21, using CXorf21-specific gRNA (CRISPRCas9), abrogated this effect. Initial pHrodo™ [20μg/ml] and Lysosensor™ [10μM] lysosomal experiments revealed that healthy male primary monocytes trend toward a higher pH, while healthy female monocytes lysosomes had a lower pH, and knockdown of CXorf21 protein resulted in an increased lysosomal pH in female monocytes, and no change in the male sample. Furthermore, treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) increased lysosomal pH in female cells. Conclusion. CXorf21 is over-expressed in female immune cells compared to male cells, and is involved in a sex-dependent dimorphic response to activation through TLR7 or NOD1. In addition, lysosomal pH is regulated by CXorf21 is a sexually dimorphic manner. We propose that CXorf21 maintains the lysosome pH environment necessary for monocyte and B cell immune response. Thus, sexual dimorphic expression of CXorf21, based on escape of X chromosome inactivation, skews (auto) antigen processing and immune response by women compared to men. CXorf21 may be a major contributor to disease pathogenesis, and sex bias of the diseases based on an X chromosome dosage effect.",L629437201 2019-10-02,,autoantigen;caspase recruitment domain protein 4;cotransporter;cytokine;endogenous compound;hydroxychloroquine;imiquimod;nuclear protein;oligopeptide;oxidoreductase;toll like receptor 7;adult;allele;antibody production;antigen presentation;conference abstract;controlled study;CRISPR-CAS9 system;dendritic cell;dose response;enzyme activity;female;gene overexpression;genetic association;genetic susceptibility;human;human cell;humoral immunity;immunocompetent cell;immunofluorescence;in vitro study;lysosome;male;monocyte;open reading frame;protein expression;protein function;quantitative analysis;real time polymerase chain reaction;systemic lupus erythematosus;Western blotting;X chromosome inactivation;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Although many factors may be contributing to this phenomenon, the exact underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Apart from the traditionally considered hormonal and environmental factors, lately the role of sex chromosomes and especially of the X chromosome has drawn much attention. In the current review, we focus on the inherent genetic imbalance between the sex chromosomes and their influence and role on gender-discordant disease presentation. To compensate for this imbalance, nature has created a defective epigenetic mechanism to silence the second rich in immune related genes X chromosome. Genes escaping silencing, transfer the genetic imbalance into the transcriptional and protein level, contributing to gender differences as reflected in functions of the innate and adaptive immunity.

This discovery, with ramifications far beyond establishing the gene for RS, represents a dramatic conclusion to an intensive, decade-long search. MECP2 encodes a methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2) involved in transcriptional silencing of a yet to be defined number and type of genes. The clinical spectrum of resultant disorders extends well beyond RS. Indeed, the clinical phenotypes for MECP2 mutations range from mild disability in the mother of a girl with RS to rapidly progressive encephalopathy in her brother. Further, the recent identification of MECP2 mutations in boys with phenotypes quite different from RS adds yet another element to the mix. Within the classic RS group, clinical severity varies remarkably, depending at least in part on the degree of non-random X-inactivation. Those with clinical patterns in the border zones of RS remain to be examined fully for less severe mutational events. Further, the pathobiology of RS and the role of transcriptional silencing as a disease-producing mechanism could be a prototype for other disorders of neurodevelopment. Thus, the identification of mutations in MECP2 creates completely new vistas as to fundamental neurobiologic processes, to disease mechanisms in the neurodevelopmental disabilities, and to potential new therapeutic strategies for RS and related disorders.","Percy, A K Journal Article Review Netherlands 2001/12/12 Brain Dev. 2001 Dec;23 Suppl 1:S202-5. doi: 10.1016/s0387-7604(01)00350-3.",10.1016/s0387-7604(01)00350-3,"Adolescent;Adult;Central Nervous System/growth & development/pathology/*physiopathology;Child;*Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone;DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics;Female;Genotype;Humans;Intellectual Disability/genetics;Male;Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2;Mutation/genetics;Phenotype;*Repressor Proteins;Rett Syndrome/*diagnosis/*genetics/physiopathology;Sex Factors;Rett Syndrome",,

In PE, male and female genetic and hormonal signaling profiles were proposed as being responsible for the maternal aberrant vascular reactivity. We hypothesized that villous trophoblast and decidua basalis of women with PE display sexual dimorphism in RNA expression profiles. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a transcriptomics (RNAseq) dataset analysis of 48 reproductive tissues (placental villi and decidua basalis) from carefully clinically phenotyped cases in the following groups: 1) spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB, n=21, GA: 29±1wks) and 2) severe PE (sPE, n=27, GA: 29±1 wks). RNAseq was performed using the Illumina platform and data analysis was completed using DESeq2 software (FDR<0.1). RESULTS: Controlling for GA, clinical phenotype, and tissue of origin, 37 transcripts differed consistently between tissues of male vs. female origin (Figure A, B). The X-Inactive Specific Transcript (XIST) that regulates X inactivation was highest in genetically female tissues, while Y-linked genes including DEAD-box helicase-3 (DDX3Y, role in RNA processing) and histone demethylase UTY were selectively expressed in male tissues.

DNA methylation may play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The aim of the present study was to study putative schizophrenia susceptibility genes across the lifespan in normal non-psychiatric subjects. Methods: We studied the DNA methylation level of selected CpG sites in the promoter region of a number of putative schizophrenia susceptibility genes (n=74) in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of non psychiatric subjects across the lifespan, using a customized GoldenGate methylation assay for Vera Code from Illumina. In addition to that, several genes previously shown to display changes in DNA methylation along the lifespan as well as four CpG sites in chromosome X known to be hypermethylated in women, were used for validation purposes. A total of 108 subjects were studied, including 31 fetal specimens. Batch effects were removed using COMBAT, model selection was performed using a STEP-wise procedure, and statistical analysis was performed using multiple linear regressions on the best fit model. The effect was considered significant if the p-value fell below the p<0.008 threshold, after correcting for multiple testing via the False Discovery Rate threshold (FDR) set at p<0.05. Results: The studied sites displayed a bimodal distribution with almost 70% having low methylation level across the lifespan (beta values <0.2) and only 7% of loci were virtually completely methylated across the lifespan (beta values >0.8). The remaining genes (24%) displayed intermediate methylation status sometimes varying as a function of age. We also observed significant sex differences in methylation of the four CpG sites in the X chromosome (poE-20), all four showing more methylation in females than in males, consistent with X inactivation. Age related differences were also observed in the methylation state for several CpG sites corresponding to 7 to 10 genes out of the 74 potential schizophrenia susceptibility genes. There were 7 genes showing significant changes in methylation over six weeks of the 2nd trimester of gestation (DLG4, CAMK2A, NTRK3, NDEL1, CIT, CNR1, GPR85), 2 genes (CAMK2A, FGF20) showed changes in the methylation status during childhood (0 to 10 years of age), and 10 genes (BDNF, CHRNA4, NDEL1, MOBP,PDE4B, DRD3, KCNH2, FGF20, RELN, PRODH) showed methylation level changes during adult life (more than 11 years of age). Discussion: In summary, our results show a lifespan change in the methylation state of a number of schizophrenia susceptibility genes, in the DLPFC of non-psychiatric controls. The changes that we have observed suggest the possibility that developmental changes in methylation status also could be related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",L70807328 2012-07-19,10.1038/npp.2010.216,DNA;cytosine;human;DNA methylation;schizophrenia;prefrontal cortex;lifespan;college;psychopharmacology;gene;methylation;female;X chromosome;model;multiple linear regression analysis;statistical analysis;gene expression;procedures;adult;childhood;second trimester pregnancy;X chromosome inactivation;male;assay;sex difference;statistical significance;pregnancy;pathophysiology;promoter region;diseases;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA Methylation;Schizophrenia,,

Yet, since the paths of primate evolution diverged, there have been remarkable developments in the behavioural and cognitive attainments of our species, which ultimately reflect subtle differences in gene structure and function. These modifications have occurred despite evolutionary constraints upon the diversity of genetic influences, on the development and function of neural tissue. Significant species differences can be observed both at the levels of function (gene expression) and structure (amino acid sequence). Protein evolution is driving an accelerating increase in brain complexity and size. Playing centre stage, in terms of the proportion of genes involved in brain development and cognitive function, is the X chromosome. Recently, it has become clear that a long-standing theory, implicating X-linked genes in a sexually antagonistic evolutionary role, is probably correct. Genes on the sex chromosomes can directly influence sexual dimorphism in cognition and behaviour, independent of the action of sex steroids. Mechanisms by which sex-chromosomal effects, due to X-linked genes, influence neural development or function are reviewed. These include the biased expression of genes subject to X-inactivation, haploinsufficiency (in males) for non-inactivated genes with no Y homology, sex-specific brain functions and genomic imprinting of X-linked loci. Evidence supporting each of these mechanisms is available from both human and animal models.

Found on the X chromosome, UTX is one of the few genes to escape X inactivation and functions as a major enhancer regulator. UTX establishes the active enhancer landscape through its histone demethylase activity as well as its ability to complex with other activating histone modifiers. UTX is implicated in many epithelial cancers and is commonly mutated or lost in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). This is supported by loss of UTX expression in cSCC upon immunohistochemical staining. UTY, the Y-linked paralog of UTX, retains minimal catalytic function but can potentially compensate for UTX loss by other mechanisms. This may account for some of the sex specific differences that have been observed in the risk and severity of cSCC, given that mutations in UTX are typically heterozygous. Despite its demonstrated role in tumor suppression across cancers, there is virtually no understanding of how it functions during epidermal homeostasis or carcinogenesis. To address these questions, we generated mice with epidermal deletions of Utx. Intriguingly, we observed that homozygous Utx knockout female mice show regions of epidermal hyperplasia, an expanded keratin 14 basal layer and increased immune invasion in the skin when compared to controls. In contrast, male mice missing their one copy of Utx, as well as heterozygous female mice lacking only one copy of Utx, appear phenotypically normal. At the transcriptional level, we find that depletion of UTX leads to numerous alterations in the expression of both immune and metabolic genes, consistent with a recent discovery that UTX senses cellular oxygen. Taken together, these data offer new insights into how UTX may be critical for maintaining epidermal homeostasis and proper gene expression, and how when lost, UTX depletion may lead to increased cancer risk.","L2019236737 2022-07-26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Maybe""}",10.1016/j.jid.2022.05.519,"cytokeratin 14;endogenous compound;histone demethylase;oxygen;adult;animal experiment;animal model;animal tissue;cancer inhibition;cancer risk;carcinogenesis;catalysis;conference abstract;controlled study;epidermis hyperplasia;female;gene expression;gene mutation;genetic association;genetic susceptibility;genetic transcription;heterozygosity;homeostasis;homozygosity;immunohistochemistry;knockout gene;male;mouse;nonhuman;paralogy;protein expression;protein function;squamous cell skin carcinoma;stratum basale (epidermis);Oxidoreductases, O-Demethylating;Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating;Histones;Homeostasis",,

In the bone marrow almost normal numbers of pre-B lymphocytes are present. These cytoplasmatic Cμ+ pre-B lymphocytes appear to express truncated M heavy chain molecules lacking the variable region segment. The T lymphocyte compartment is intact: the numbers of mature T cell receptor (TcR) αβ expressing T lymphocyte populations and their proliferative responses to antigens are normal. That the B cells are primary and exclusively affected was proven by X-chromosome inactivation studies. There is no evidence that the XLA gene is directly involved in the Ig gene rearrangements since B lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCLs) established from peripheral blood of XLA patients were found to produce IgM molecules composed of complete Ig heavy and light chains and were shown to contain normal V(H)DJ(H) recombinations. The data do not exclude the involvement of the XLA gene in a B cell specific process that makes the Ig loci accessible for recombination. Investigations on the degree of diversity of immunoglobulins generated by XLA patients exposed no limitations in the V(H) family usage. Sequence analysis of expressed V(H)3 and V(H)4 rearrangements however revealed that some genetic elements of the Ig locus might be overrepresented and that a high portion of rearrangements was generated by unconventional mechanisms. By restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) and pulsed field gel electrophoreses analyses the XLA gene was mapped to an 8- to 12-Mb DNA fragment located in the Xq22 region.

Scoliosis is present in some FraX patients and both humans with FraX and mice lacking FMR1 (KO), a model for FraX, exhibit craniofacial abnormalities. However, the rest of the skeleton has not been studied. We now report that FMR1 is expressed in bone preparations, and in osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts. Hemizygous maleKO(x-/y), homozygous femaleKO(x-/x-) and WT2-month-old mice of both sexes were used. FMR1 deletion did not alter femur length (14.7 ± 1.0 and 14.4 ± 1.1mm for male and 14.7 ± 0.3 and 14.7 ± 0.5mm for female WT and KO mice, respectively). mCT analysis showed that vertebra cancellous BV/TV was significantly reduced (9%) with low TbTh (10%) inKOfemale mice. Similar decrease in BV/TV (12%) with low TbN (9%) and high TbS (8%) were found in KO male mice. Further, bone material density was slightly, but significantly decreased in both male and female mice. This change in material density could be due to an increase in bone remodeling, resulting in newer, less mineralized bone, or to a defect in bone mineralization. Consistent with the first possibility, CTX measured in whole tibia bone lysates was 72% higher in KOfemale mice compared to WT controls. Osteoclastic gene (CatK and CalR) and RANKL expression was high, and OPG was low in female KO mice compared to WT mice. Female FMR1 x+/x-mice exhibited a similar, but more modest bone phenotype possibly due to X-inactivation mosaicism, with 60% increase in bone CTX levels. Male KO mice showed a tendency towards higher CTX levels, without reaching significance, and higher RANKL/OPG ratio without changes in osteoclastic genes in bone. While similar osteoclastic gene phenotype and increased DKK1 and ALP levels were found in both sexes, opposite effects of FMR1 deletion were detected in osteocytic genes. Thus, E11 was lower and Sost was higher in females, and the genes were respectively increased and decreased in male KO mice. Further osteocalcin and collagen1a1 were only decreased in female mice. In summary, FMR1 deletion results in low bone mass and high bone resorption in both sexes, but might have different effects in osteoblast-osteocyte transition in female versus male KO mice. This evidence, together with studies showing defective dendrite formation in FMR1-deficient neurons, raise the possibility of a role of FMR1 in osteocytogenesis in a sex specific manner.","L620202398 2018-02-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Nala""=>""Maybe""}",10.1002/jbmr.3363,collagen type 1;dickkopf 1 protein;endogenous compound;fragile X mental retardation protein;osteocalcin;osteoclast differentiation factor;adult;animal cell;animal experiment;animal model;autism;bone defect;bone mass;bone mineralization;bone remodeling;conference abstract;controlled study;craniofacial malformation;dendrite;female;femur;fragile X syndrome;gene deletion;genetic association;homozygosity;knockout mouse;male;mosaicism;mouse;nonhuman;osteoblast;osteoclast;osteocyte;osteolysis;phenotype;rest;scoliosis;skeleton;tibia;vertebra;wild type mouse;X chromosome inactivation;Gene Expression;Bone Resorption;Bone and Bones,,

For example, females with BD are at a greater risk of rapid cycling and are more likely to engage in binge-eating behavior. The number of copies of X chromosome variants differ between males and females, and we hypothesize that X chromosome variants may be associated with sex-specific characteristics of BD. Few studies have explored the role of the X chromosome in BD, due in part to the analytical challenge posed by its unique, sex-dependent biology. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is an epigenetic process that silences one of the two copies of the X chromosome in females. Most statistical methods either ignore that XCI occurs, or falsely assume that all variants are inactivated. These methods are overly simplistic, because in reality 15-20% of genes escape from XCI and are expressed from both copies. In this talk, we review current approaches to analyze X chromosome data (e.g. coding traditionally implemented in PLINK software vs. coding recommended by Clayton), and the biological models that are assumed by each approach. We propose new approaches to assess the contribution of X chromosome variants inspired by X chromosome biology that account for whether a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may be undergoing or escaping XCI. In the first approach (‘combined approach’), we fit a logistic regression model assuming additive genetic effects and adjust for sex. Then, we code the SNP either assuming one copy is expressed, or two copies are expressed, depending on prior knowledge about which regions are inactivated. In the second approach (‘interaction approach’), we fit a logistic regression model with a sex, SNP, and SNP-sex interaction effect that is flexible to whether the region is inactivated or escaping XCI. We applied both of these approaches in a meta-analysis of two studies of BD, including 957 BD patients from the Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder Biobank and 1001 BD patients from the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN). We examined the association of over 14,000 X chromosome SNPs with BD and sex-associated BD traits, such as rapid cycling, suicide attempts, substance abuse, and binge eating. No SNPs were significant after correction for multiple testing in the ‘combined approach’. Using the ‘interaction’ approach, intergenic SNP rs5932307 was associated with BD (P=1.1E-7), with a stronger effect in females (OR_M=1.13, OR_F=1.97). Further work should validate these findings in larger sample sizes. The best way to assess X chromosome variants remains on open question, although incorporating prior biological knowledge in particular regions may shed light on the contributions of X chromosome variants to risk of BD and other psychiatric disorders with sex-dependent characteristics or prevalence.

There are also known differences in birthweight centile with males generally being larger than females at birth. These differences are generally ignored when studying obstetric complications of pregnancy and the mechanisms that confer these differences between the sexes are unknown. Current evidence suggests sex specific adaptation of the placenta may be central to the differences in fetal growth and survival. Our research examining pregnancies complicated by asthma has reported sexually dimorphic differences in fetal growth and survival with males adapting placental function to allow for continued growth in an adverse maternal environment while females reduce growth in an attempt to survive further maternal insults. We have reported sex differences in placental cytokine expression, insulin-like growth factor pathways and the placental response to cortisol in relation to the complication of asthma during pregnancy. More recently we have identified sex specific alterations in placental function in pregnancies complicated by preterm delivery which were associated with neonatal outcome and survival. We propose the sexually dimorphic differences in growth and survival of the fetus are mediated by the sex specific function of the human placenta. This review will present evidence supporting this hypothesis and will argue that to ignore the sex of the placenta is no longer sound scientific practice.

Prenatal stress is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, including early onset schizophrenia and autism, which display marked malebiases in onset, presentation, and treatment. In our mouse model of early prenatal stress (EPS), stress exposure during the first week of gestation imparts long-term neurodevelopmental programming deficits in male offspring resulting in a hypersensitivity to stress, cognitive impairments, and metabolic programming. As the placenta, a fetally-derived organ reflecting fetal sex chromosome complement, is a key modulator between the maternal and fetal compartment, functional changes occurring here in response to maternal insults can have significant and sex-specific effects on neurodevelopment. We previously identified the X-linked gene and chromatin regulator, O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (OGT), as a placental biomarker of prenatal stress. OGT escapes X-inactivation in the placenta, providing females with an increased capacity to regulate transcription at the level of the trophoblast cell. Placental-specific reduction of OGT recapitulates the neurodevelopmental and metabolic impairments associated with EPS exposure. Methods: As OGT is known to modify several epigenetic regulators associated with histone methylation, specifically the transcriptional repressive mark, H3K27me3, we hypothesized that sex differences in levels of OGT mediate sex differences in histone methylation and promote robust sexspecific programs of gene expression. Females have significantly more H3K27me3 in placental trophoblasts than males, thus we hypothesize that female-biased epigenetic repression protects females from prenatal insults such as EPS. EPS or deletion of OGT only in trophoblast cells was also compared between male and female placental tissue for changes in H3K27me3 and transcriptional responses to stress using RiboTag transgenic mice. We have used an array of methods including ChIP-Seq, protein biochemistry, and RNA-Seq in mouse placentas with trophoblast-specific OGT reduction and mapped the corresponding changes in the embryonic brain. Further, we specifically reduced H3K27me3 levels in female placentas to that of male levels using trophoblast-specific genetic manipulations of the H3K27me3 methyltransferase, EZH2, and then compared sex-specific vulnerability to EPS. Results: We found that OGT profoundly regulates genomewide sex differences in levels of H3K27me3 and gene expression in placental trophoblast cells. EPS significantly increased transcriptional changes in male trophoblast cells, but not in females. Decreased placental H3K27me3 or EZH2 increased female vulnerability to the effects of EPS including changes in transcriptional repression in the placenta, and in programming of offspring behaviors including increased HPA axis sensitivity, metabolic deficiencies, and cognitive impairments in adulthood. Conclusions: These studies reveal profound sex-differences in mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in placental trophoblast cells that directly contribute to increased risk for the developing male brain to maternal insults across gestation. Such outcomes may point to useful biomarkers in predicting neurodevelopmental disease risk or resilience.",L613896384 2017-01-02,10.1038/npp.2016.239,biological marker;endogenous compound;histone H3;methyltransferase;n acetylglucosamine;transcription factor EZH2;adulthood;animal experiment;animal model;behavior;biochemistry;brain;chromatin immunoprecipitation;cognitive defect;controlled study;DNA transcription;embryo;epigenetic repression;epigenetics;exposure;female;fetus;gene deletion;gene expression;gene inactivation;genetic manipulation;genetic marker;histone methylation;male;mouse;nervous system development;nervous system malformation;nonhuman;organ;placenta tissue;pregnancy;prenatal stress;progeny;sex chromosome;sex difference;transcription initiation;transcription regulation;transgenic mouse;trophoblast;X chromosome inactivation;Embryonic and Fetal Development,,

Here, we explore the accumulating evidence for a significant genetic component to mammalian sexual dimorphism through the paradigm of sex chromosome evolution. The differences between the extant X and Y chromosomes, at both a sequence and regulatory level, arose across 166 million years. A functional result of these differences is cell autonomous sexual dimorphism. By understanding the process that changed a pair of homologous ancestral autosomes into the extant mammalian X and Y, we believe it easier to consider the mechanisms that may contribute to hormone-independent male-female differences.

An additional complication is the existence of genes that escape X inactivation and thus are ubiquitously expressed from both alleles in females. The mosaic nature of X-linked gene expression and the potential for escape can vary between individuals, tissues, cell types and stages of life. Our understanding of the specialized nature of X-linked genes and of the multilayer epigenetic regulation that influence their expression throughout the organism has been helped by molecular studies conducted by tissue-specific and single-cell-specific approaches.

In this review we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the genetics and epigenetics of the X chromosome. The X chromosome shares limited conservation with its ancestral homologue the Y chromosome and the resulting difference in X-chromosome dosage between males and females is largely compensated for by X-chromosome inactivation. The process of inactivation is initiated by the long non-coding RNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) and achieved through interaction with multiple synergistic silencing pathways. Identification of Xist-interacting proteins has given insight into these processes yet the cascade of events from initiation to maintenance have still to be resolved. In particular, the initiation of inactivation in humans has been challenging to study as: it occurs very early in development; most human embryonic stem cell lines already have an inactive X; and the process seems to differ from mouse. Another difference between human and mouse X inactivation is the larger number of human genes that escape silencing. In humans over 20% of X-linked genes continue to be expressed from the otherwise inactive X chromosome. We are only beginning to understand how such escape occurs but there is growing recognition that escapees contribute to sexually dimorphic traits. The unique biology and epigenetics of the X chromosome have often led to its exclusion from disease studies, yet the X constitutes 5% of the genome and is an important contributor to disease, often in a sex-specific manner.",L2011769188 2021-05-20,10.1093/hmg/ddy148,adult;animal cell;animal experiment;epigenetics;female;gene silencing;genetic transcription;human;human embryonic stem cell;male;mouse;nonhuman;review;stem cell line;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;endogenous compound;long untranslated RNA;X Chromosome,,

These long-term effects can be traced to pre- and post-implantation development, and in both cases, the effects are usually sex specific. During preimplantation development, male and female embryos exhibit an extensive transcriptional dimorphism mainly driven by incomplete X chromosome inactivation. These early developmental stages are crucial for the establishment of epigenetic marks that will be conserved throughout development, making it a particularly susceptible period for the appearance of long-term epigenetic-based phenotypes. Later in development, gonadal formation generates hormonal differences between the sexes, and male and female placentae exhibit different responses to environmental stressors. The maternal environment, including hormones and environmental insults during pregnancy, contributes to sex-specific placental development that controls genetic and epigenetic programming during foetal development, regulating sex-specific differences, including sex-specific epigenetic responses to environmental hazards, leading to long-term effects. This review summarizes several human and animal studies examining sex-specific responses to environmental stressors during both the periconception period (caused by differences in sex chromosome dosage) and placental development (caused by both sex chromosomes and hormones).

During that time it has accumulated a disproportionate number of genes concerned with mental functions. Evidence is emerging, from studies of both humans and mice, for a general influence upon intelligence (as indicated by the large number of X-linked mental retardation syndromes). In addition, there is evidence for relatively specific effects of X-linked genes on social-cognition and emotional regulation. Sexually dimorphic processes could be influenced by several mechanisms. First, a small number of X-linked genes are apparently expressed differently in male and female brains in mouse models. Secondly, many human X-linked genes outside the X-Y pairing pseudoautosomal regions escape X-inactivation. Dosage differences in the expression of such genes (which might comprise at least 20% of the total) are likely to play an important role in male-female neural differentiation. To date, little is known about the process but clues can be gleaned from the study of X-monosomic females who are haploinsufficient for expression of all non-inactivated genes relative to 46,XX females. Finally, from studies of both X-monosomic humans (45,X) and mice (39,X), we are learning more about the influences of X-linked imprinted genes upon brain structure and function.

E.",,,,,"The theory of developmental programming suggests that diseases such as the metabolic syndrome may be 'programmed' by exposure to adverse stimuli during early development. The developmental programming literature encompasses the study of a wide range of suboptimal intrauterine environments in a variety of species and correlates these with diverse phenotypic outcomes in the offspring. At a molecular level, a large number of variables have been measured and suggested as the basis of the programmed phenotype. The range of both dependent and independent variables studied often makes the developmental programming literature complex to interpret and the drawing of definitive conclusions difficult. A common, though under-explored, theme of many developmental programming models is a sex difference in offspring outcomes. This holds true across a range of interventions, including dietary, hypoxic, and surgical models. The molecular and phenotypic outcomes of adverse in utero conditions are often more prominent in male than female offspring, although there is little consideration given to the basis for this observation in most studies. We review the evidence that maternal energy investment in male and female conceptuses may not be equal and may be environment dependent. It is suggested that male and female development could be viewed as separate processes from the time of conception, with differences in both timing and outcomes.

About three fourth of the patients afflicted with AIDs are women suggesting that sex differences impact the incidence of AID. However, the proportion of females to males suffering from AID varies depending on the disease. The response to some AID therapeutics also differs in females versus males, suggesting that enrollment of adequate numbers of women and men is important in clinical trials for development of AID drugs. It is known for a long time that genetic factors are important contributors to AID susceptibility. Currently available information suggests that multiple genes with modest association to AID contribute to susceptibility to AID. Also, the associations may differ for the various ethnicities. The major histocompatibility (MHC) locus appears to be a major genetic factor that confers susceptibility to multiple AIDs, even though the locus is complex and has the highest density of genes in the human genome. Thus, the association of different AIDs could be with different genes in the MHC locus. Among the non-MHC genes, some of the risk alleles are shared between different AIDs, but may not be common to all AIDs. For example, genetic polymorphisms in the Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase-22 (PTPN22) gene have reproducibly shown to have association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Graves' disease (GD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS), but not with psoriasis. Identification of factors responsible for risk for developing AID and the of the pathways underlying these diseases are likely to help understand subsets of disease, identify responders to a specific treatment and develop better therapeutics for AID. © 2011.",L51786452 2011-12-29 2012-04-02,10.1016/j.jaut.2011.12.001,azathioprine;cyclophosphamide;fingolimod;major histocompatibility antigen class 1;major histocompatibility antigen class 2;mitoxantrone;natalizumab;non receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase 22;steroid;Addison disease;ankylosing spondylitis;article;autoimmune disease;autoimmune hepatitis;autoimmune thyroiditis;autoimmunity;celiac disease;chronic active hepatitis;clinical trial (topic);dermatomyositis;disease predisposition;dizygotic twins;DNA methylation;drug screening;enteritis;environmental factor;ethnicity;gene expression profiling;genetic association;genetic polymorphism;genetic risk;genetic susceptibility;genomics;glomerulonephritis;Goodpasture syndrome;Graves disease;Guillain Barre syndrome;heredity;histone modification;human;hypothyroidism;immunoglobulin A nephropathy;immunosuppressive treatment;insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;major histocompatibility complex;medication therapy management;monosomy X;monozygotic twins;multiple sclerosis;myasthenia gravis;pernicious anemia;polymyositis;prevalence;primary biliary cirrhosis;priority journal;psoriasis;rheumatoid arthritis;sex difference;Sjoegren syndrome;steroid therapy;survival rate;systemic lupus erythematosus;systemic sclerosis;T lymphocyte;thyroid function;thyroidectomy;treatment outcome;treatment response;twin concordance;uveitis;vitiligo;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Sex Characteristics;Autoimmune Diseases;Genome;Genomics,,

For this reason, X chromosome has recently become subject of great interest and attention and numerous studies have been aimed at understanding the role of genes on the X chromosome in triggering and maintaining the autoimmune aggression. Autoimmune diseases are indeed a growing heath burden affecting cumulatively up to 10% of the general population. It is intriguing that most X-linked primary immune deficiencies carry significant autoimmune manifestations, thus illustrating the critical role played by products of single gene located on the X chromosome in the onset, function and homeostasis of the immune system. Again, the plethora of autoimmune stigmata observed in patients with Turner syndrome, a disease due to the lack of one X chromosome or the presence of major X chromosome deletions, indicate that X-linked genes play a unique and major role in autoimmunity. There have been several reports on a role of X chromosome gene dosage through inactivation or duplication in women with autoimmune diseases, for example through a higher rate of circulating cells with a single X chromosome (i.e. with X monosomy). Finally, a challenge for researchers in the coming years will be to dissect the role for the large number of X-linked microRNAs from the perspective of autoimmune disease development. Taken together, X chromosome might well constitute the common trait of the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, other than to explain the female preponderance of these conditions.

These hypotheses have gained credence mostly because many of these diseases appear or fluctuate when there are hormonal changes such as in late adolescence and pregnancy.

These self-renewing pluripotent cells are derived from spare human blastocyst embryos. Although the factors limiting their rather inefficient derivation are not fully understood, embryo gender was suggested to be one of them. The aim of this study was to analyze the sex ratio in our disease-bearing-HESC lines in an attempt to identify the origins of sex discrepancy. Methods: We describe a large collection of disease-bearing-HESC lines, which we established in the Tel Aviv Sourasky and Shaare Zedek Medical Centers, in Israel. These HESC lines were all established exclusively from genetically affected embryos that were donated by couples undergoing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) treatment, in compliance with protocols approved by the National Ethics Committee and the acceptance of a written informed consent. The HESC lines were molecularly characterized for gender type, and the ratio between male and female lines was compared. The gender of in vitro-derived embryos was determined by PGD. A one-sample binomial test was applied to determine whether the proportion of females significantly deviates from the 50% expected. Results: Our collection includes 42 different HESC lines with dominant (17) and recessive (3) conditions, as well as X-linked disorders (20) and chromosomal rearrangements (2). Interestingly, while characterizing these cells, we found that 76% of them were females, a value statistically different from the expected 50% (P < 0.01), and even more pronounced when taking into account the fact that more male inner cell mass (ICMs) were plated for HESC derivation (53% of all blastocysts). The increase in females observed among our HESC lines persisted even following the exclusion of all cases of Xlinked conditions, reaching a bias of 80% females. To verify this finding, we performed a meta-analysis and integrated our data with the results of all 148 PGD-HESC lines on gender distribution published to date worldwide. Similar to the female sex bias found in our collection, 67% of them were females (P = 0.0001). In order to determine the origin of the gender bias that we had observed in our HESC lines, we took advantage of the PGD for X-linked diseases which enables embryo gender determination at various stages of preimplantation development, prior to their manipulation for stem cell derivation. No bias towards females was found in day 3 embryos (45.9% females), as well as in their development towards the blastocyst stage (P > 0.05). Moreover, only 48.0% (96/200) of PGD newborn babies were females, which is not statistically different from the percentage of females born following IVF-ICSI (51.3%; P > 0.05). Conclusions: The clear-cut tendency for female preponderance in HESC lines could be attributed to suboptimal culture conditions rather than from a true gender imbalance in embryos used for derivation of HESC lines. We propose a mechanism in which aberrant X chromosome inactivation and/or overexpression of critical metabolic X-linked genes might explain this sex dimorphism.",L70526140 2011-09-12,10.1093/humrep/26.s1.93,female;human;embryonic stem cell;cell line;embryology;society;reproduction;embryo;gender;blastocyst;X chromosome linked disorder;male;cells by body anatomy;art;pluripotent stem cell;sex ratio;Israel;diagnosis;intracytoplasmic sperm injection;informed consent;in vitro study;inner cell mass;meta analysis;gender bias;sex determination;stem cell;newborn;baby;X chromosome inactivation;gene;sex difference;professional standard;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Cell Line,,

Does X chromosome copy number contribute to sex differences in early embryonic metabolism? Summary answer: Chromosome X contains several metabolism-related genes that are expressed prior to X-inactivation, suggesting that their dosage plays a role in sex-biased regulation of embryo metabolism. What is known already: Published reports indicate that sex differences in preimplantation embryo metabolism exist across mammalian species, including humans. Two observations supporting this are that male embryos reach blastocyst stage earlier than their female counterparts, and that glucose uptake and processing is thought to be higher in female compared to male embryos. It has been hypothesized that these differences reflect the location of the metabolism gene G6PD, the rate limiting enzyme in the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, on Chromosome X. Study design, size, duration: This study is a reanalysis of publicly available RNA-seq data, including 1176 single cells from 59 blastocysts (24 E5, 18 E6, 17 E7) published in one study (Petropoulos et al 2016). Participants/materials, setting, methods: Cells were subjected to a digital karyotype inference algorithm and aneuploid samples were removed from the dataset. Sex differential gene expression analyses (DE) were then performed in euploid trophectoderm cells (TE; 233 XY from 16 embryos and 180 XX cells from 12 embryos). Cell numbers from ICM were too sparse to compare. Main results and the role of chance: Analysis of XX and XY TE revealed 618 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 507 upregulated in XX cells, and 111 upregulated in XY cells). These genes are spread across autosomes and sex chromosomes. Interestingly, G6PD is not significantly more highly expressed in XX cells. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the XX-biased DEGs revealed a transcriptional sex bias in metabolism-related GO categories, including mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport, and respiratory chain complex I. Gene-level assessment revealed that the drivers of these enrichments are spread across the genome, but 28/64 reside on Chromosome X (hypergeometric p-value = 5.984473e-27), including NDUFA1, NDUFB11, and COX7B (components of the electron transport chain), and SLC25A5 (an ATP/ADP transporter involved in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential). This indicates a direct role for multiple X-linked genes in sex-biased regulation of embryo metabolism. Metabolic genes that are not sex-biased are distributed across the genome, with no significant enrichment on Chromosome X (76/266, hypergeometric p-value=0.607). Together, these data indicate that GO metabolic term X enrichment is a feature of sex-biased expression and not due to an accumulation of metabolism-related genes on the X. Limitations, reasons for caution: This analysis draws on publicly available data, and thus we are unable to perform orthogonal validation of karyotype calls. Additionally, while the initial dataset is large, the quality-filtered dataset (euploid XX and XY TE) is small, and single cell data is infamously variable. Further data collection is required. Wider implications of the findings: Our analysis of sex-biased gene expression in early human embryos suggests a more important role for the X chromosome in modulating sex biases in early embryo metabolism than previously recognized.

Summary answer: There are imbalanced expression of sexual chromosomes between gender from the embryonic genome activation (EGA), with a dosage compensation firstly occurring in female trophectoderm cells. What is known already: Several animal studies have demonstrated that the gender has an effect in the kinetics and metabolism of early embryo develop-ment. At the stage before implantation, sex-specific differences in gene expression become apparent. In rodents, this period of double X chromosome activation occurs between 4-cell and 16-cell stages, but the equivalent timing is uncertain in human embryos. Failure to accomplish dosage compensation normally results in early miscarriage and embryonic lethality. In human, the dosage compensation is started by silencing the expression of both X chromosomes in blastocyst embryos, while the exact procedure remains unclear. Study design, size, duration: We performed global expression analysis between males and females using single-cell RNA-sequencing data of 1585 individual cells from 98 human preimplantation embryos, covering development stages from 8-cell to late blastocyst. Participants/materials, setting, methods: We classified all the cells from E3 to E7, corresponding to their developmental stages from 8-cell to late blastocyst. An average of 20 embryos were analyzed per embryonic day. We determined the sex of each embryo after assessing the expression level of Y-linked genes for each cell. Then we performed the comparison of expression between gender for each stage. Main results and the role of chance: We provide a comprehensive com-parison of transcriptional atlas between sex of human preimplantation embryos and reveals the dynamics of sex chromosomes during embryogenesis for the first time. Consistent chromosome-wide transcriptomic level of autosomes was observed in all stages, while sex chromosomes showed significant differences after EGA. We observed a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes on X chromosome at the 8-cell stage, on both X and Y chromosomes at the morula stage, and on Y chromosome at the blastocyst stage(P < 0.001). Two of the DE genes on Y chromosome, RPS4Y1 and DDX3Y, achieved abundant expression in all male cells immediately beyond the completion of EGA and could be used as a gender marker in male embryos. For X chromosomes in female, over 100 significantly higher expressed genes were defined in 8-cell stage and both alleles of most heterozygous sites could be detected in our allelic analysis. Contrary to constant pattern of Y chromosome, the expression of X chromosome distinctly dropped at late blastocyst stage, especially in trophecto-derm cells, revealing the exact time point and details of dosage compensation. Limitations, reasons for caution: Lack of genomic data to verify the gender of each embryo is the limitation of this study. In addition, in the allelic analysis, we still need the variants of embryonic genome to get more informative sites.

Epidemiological data and observational reports from both the original SARS epidemic and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic have a common feature: males are more likely to exhibit enhanced disease severity and mortality than females. Sex differences in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 share mechanistic foundations, namely, the involvement of both the innate immune system and the canonical renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Immunological differences suggest that females mount a rapid and aggressive innate immune response, and the attenuated antiviral response in males may confer enhanced susceptibility to severe disease. Furthermore, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is involved in disease pathogenesis in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, either to serve as a protective mechanism by deactivating the RAS or as the receptor for viral entry, respectively. Loss of membrane ACE2 and a corresponding increase in plasma ACE2 are associated with worsened cardiovascular disease outcomes, a mechanism attributed to a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM17). SARS-CoV-2 infection also leads to ADAM17 activation, a positive feedback cycle that exacerbates ACE2 loss.

However, little focus has been on exploring gender differences in the antidiuretic response to desmopressin. Based on an exploratory analysis from three clinical trials, we report a significant gender difference in the effects of desmopressin on nocturnal urine volume that could not be explained by pharmacokinetic differences. Mean desmopressin concentration profiles were tested for covariates, and age and gender were not statistically significant and only weight was significant for log(C-max) (P = 0.0183) and borderline significant for log(AUC) (P = 0.0571). The decrease in nocturnal urine volume in nocturia patients treated with desmopressin over 28 days was significantly larger for women at the lower desmopressin melt doses of 10 and 25 mu g than for men. The ED50 for men was modeled to be 43.2 mu g and 16.1 mu g for women, with the ED50 men/women estimated to be 2.7 (1.3-8.1 95% CI), corresponding to significantly higher sensitivity to desmopressin in women. An increasing incidence of hyponatremia with increasing dose was found, and at the highest dose level of 100 mu g decreases in serum sodium were approximately twofold greater in women over 50 yr of age than in men. A new dose recommendation stratified by gender is suggested in the treatment of nocturia: for men, 50- to 100-mu g melt is an efficacious and safe dose, while for women a dose of 25 mu g melt is recommended as efficacious with no observed incidences of hyponatremia.

Its key function is in the kidneys, facilitating the urine concentrating mechanism through the AVP/V2 type receptor/aquaporin 2 system in the medullary and cortical collecting ducts. Recent clinical and research observations strongly support the existence of an extrarenal V2R. The clinical importance of the extrarenal V2R spans widely from stimulation of coagulation factor in the endothelium to as yet untested potential therapeutic targets. These include V2R-regulated membranous fluid turnover in the inner ear, V2R-regulated mitogensis and apoptosis in certain tumor tissues, and numerous other cell types where the physiological role of V2Rs still requires further research. Here, we review current evidence on the physiological and pathophysiological functions of renal and extrarenal V2Rs. These functions of V2R are important, not only in rare diseases with loss or gain of function of V2R but also in relation to the recent use of nonpeptide V2R antagonists to treat hyponatremia and possibly retard the growth of cysts and development of renal failure in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The main functions of V2R in principal cells of the collecting duct are water, salt, and urea transport by modifying the trafficking of aquaporin 2, epithelial Na+ channels, and urea transporters and vasodilation and stimulation of coagulation factor properties, mainly seen with pharmacological doses of 1-desamino-8-D-AVP.

In the investigator-blind, randomized, parallel group study, 5 dose groups and 1 placebo group, each consisting of 12 healthy, overhydrated, nonsmoking male subjects 18-55 yr of age were infused intravenously over 2 h with placebo or 30, 60, 125, 250, and 500 ng desmopressin in 50 ml of normal saline. Plasma desmopressin and urine osmolality rose by variable amounts during the infusions of 60, 125, 250, and 500 ng desmopressin. Plotting mean urine osmolality against the concurrent mean plasma desmopressin yielded a temporal delay between pharmacokinetic (PK) and -dynamic (PD) responses in all dose groups. Using simulation from the indirect-response model, assuming a constant (4 ng/ml) desmopressin concentration, this delay between PK and PD was estimated at 4 h (10th-90th percentile: 1.8-8.1). Within each group, however, there were large individual variations (2- to 10-fold) in the magnitude and duration of the antidiuretic effect. The antidiuretic effect of intravenous desmopressin in water-loaded healthy adults varies considerably due largely to factors other than individual differences in pharmacokinetics. The antidiuretic effect is time as well as dose dependent and may be self-amplifying. The most likely explanation for these findings is that the time required for a given level of plasma desmopressin to exert its maximum antidiuretic effect varies markedly from person to person due to individual differences in the kinetics of one or more of the intracellular mechanisms that promote the reabsorption of solute-free water by principal cells in renal collecting tubules.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 14 Total Times Cited: 16 Cited Reference Count: 33,10.1152/ajprenal.00502.2012,desmopressin;antidiuresis;pharmacokinetics;DIABETES-INSIPIDUS;DIFFERENTIAL-DIAGNOSIS;CONTINENCE-SOCIETY;UREA TRANSPORTERS;SEX-DIFFERENCES;X-INACTIVATION;VASOPRESSIN;AQUAPORIN-2;KIDNEY;EXPRESSION;Deamino Arginine Vasopressin,,

To identify escape genes in vivo and to explore molecular mechanisms that regulate this process we analyzed the allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed XCI and distinguishable alleles based on single nucleotide polymorphisms. Using a binomial model to assess allelic expression, we demonstrate a continuum between complete silencing and expression from the inactive X (Xi). The validity of the RNA-seq approach was verified using RT-PCR with species-specific primers or Sanger sequencing. Both common escape genes and genes with significant differences in XCI status between tissues were identified. Such genes may be candidates for tissue-specific sex differences. Overall, few genes (3-7%) escape XCI in any of the mouse tissues examined, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. In contrast, an in vitro system represented by the embryonic-kidney-derived Patski cell line showed a higher density of escape genes (21%), representing both kidney-specific escape genes and cell-line specific escape genes. Allele-specific RNA polymerase II occupancy and DNase I hypersensitivity at the promoter of genes on the Xi correlated well with levels of escape, consistent with an open chromatin structure at escape genes. Allele-specific CTCF binding on the Xi clustered at escape genes and was denser in brain compared to the Patski cell line, possibly contributing to a more compartmentalized structure of the Xi and fewer escape genes in brain compared to the cell line where larger domains of escape were observed.","1553-7404 Berletch, Joel B Ma, Wenxiu Yang, Fan Shendure, Jay Noble, William S Disteche, Christine M Deng, Xinxian MH099628/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States MH083949/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States GM046883/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States R01 MH083949/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States R21 MH099628/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States R01 GM113943/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States U41 HG007000/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States R01 GM046883/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States R01 GM098039/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States GM098039/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2015/03/19 PLoS Genet. 2015 Mar 18;11(3):e1005079. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005079. eCollection 2015 Mar.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1005079,"Animals;CCCTC-Binding Factor;Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism;Female;Mice;Organ Specificity;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;RNA Polymerase II/metabolism;Repressor Proteins/metabolism;Sequence Analysis, RNA;*X Chromosome Inactivation",,

By using a linear mixed model, we estimate that on average 2.6% of the additive genetic variance in these twelve traits is attributable to chrX, this being in proportion to the number of SNPs in the chromosome. In a chrX-wide association analysis, we identify three novel loci: two for height (rs182838724 near FGF16/ATRX/MAGT1, joint P-value = 2.71×10(-9), and rs1751138 near ITM2A, P-value = 3.03×10(-10)) and one for fasting insulin (rs139163435 in Xq23, P-value = 5.18×10(-9)). Further, we find that effect sizes for variants near ITM2A, a gene implicated in cartilage development, show evidence for a lack of dosage compensation. This observation is further supported by a sex-difference in ITM2A expression in whole blood (P-value = 0.00251), and is also in agreement with a previous report showing ITM2A escapes from X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in the majority of women. Hence, our results show one of the first links between phenotypic variation in a population sample and an XCI-escaping locus and pinpoint ITM2A as a potential contributor to the sexual dimorphism in height.

In mouse ovary where Rhox6 and 9 remain highly expressed, KDM6A occupancy strongly correlates with expression.

We employed a unique mouse model, known as the ""four core genotypes,"" to distinguish between effects of gonadal sex (testes or ovaries) and sex chromosomes (XX or XY). With this model, we produced gonadal male and female mice carrying XX or XY sex chromosome complements. Mice were gonadectomized to remove the acute effects of gonadal hormones and to uncover effects of sex chromosome complement on obesity. Mice with XX sex chromosomes (relative to XY), regardless of their type of gonad, had up to 2-fold increased adiposity and greater food intake during daylight hours, when mice are normally inactive. Mice with two X chromosomes also had accelerated weight gain on a high fat diet and developed fatty liver and elevated lipid and insulin levels. Further genetic studies with mice carrying XO and XXY chromosome complements revealed that the differences between XX and XY mice are attributable to dosage of the X chromosome, rather than effects of the Y chromosome. A subset of genes that escape X chromosome inactivation exhibited higher expression levels in adipose tissue and liver of XX compared to XY mice, and may contribute to the sex differences in obesity.

How do men cope with having only a single X chromosome given that virtually all other chromosomal monosomies are lethal? Ironically, or even typically many might say, women and more generally female mammals contribute most to the job by shutting down one of their two X chromosomes at random. This phenomenon, called X-inactivation, was originally described some 50 years ago by Mary Lyon and has captivated an increasing number of scientists ever since. The fascination arose in part from the realisation that the inactive X corresponded to a dense heterochromatin mass called the ""Barr body"" whose number varied with the number of Xs within the nucleus and from the many intellectual questions that this raised: How does the cell count the X chromosomes in the nucleus and inactivate all Xs except one? What kind of molecular mechanisms are able to trigger such a profound, chromosome-wide metamorphosis? When is X-inactivation initiated? How is it transmitted to daughter cells and how is it reset during gametogenesis?

A. and Blekhman, R. and Merino-Martinez, R. and Gilad, Y. and Jazin, E.",,,,,"The question of a potential biological sexual signature in the human brain is a heavily disputed subject. In order to provide further insight into this issue, we used an evolutionary approach to identify genes with sex differences in brain expression level among primates. We reasoned that expression patterns important to uphold key male and female characteristics may be conserved during evolution. We selected cortex for our studies because this specific brain region is responsible for many higher behavioral functions. We compared gene expression profiles in the occipital cortex of male and female humans (Homo sapiens, a great ape) and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis, an old world monkey), two catarrhine species that show abundant morphological sexual dimorphism, as well as in common marmosets (Callithrix Jacchus, a new world monkey) which are relatively sexually monomorphic. We identified hundreds of genes with sex-biased expression patterns in humans and macaques, while fewer than ten were differentially expressed between the sexes in marmosets. In primates, a general rule is that many of the morphological and behavioral sexual dimorphisms seen in polygamous species, such as macaques, are typically less pronounced in monogamous species such as the marmosets. Our observations suggest that this correlation may also be reflected in the extent of sex-biased gene expression in the brain. We identified 85 genes with common sex-biased expression, in both human and macaque and 2 genes, X inactivation-specific transcript (XIST) and Heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSBP1), that were consistently sex-biased in the female direction in human, macaque, and marmoset. These observations imply a conserved signature of sexual gene expression dimorphism in cortex of primates. Further, we found that the coding region of female-biased genes is more evolutionarily constrained compared to the coding region of both male-biased and non sex-biased brain expressed genes.

We hypothesized that epigenetic sex differences may also result from sex hormone functions, in particular from long-lasting androgen programming. We aimed at investigating whether inactivation of the androgen receptor, the key regulator of normal male sex development, is associated with differences of the patterns of DNA methylation marks in genital tissues. To this end, we performed large scale array-based analysis of gene methylation profiles on genomic DNA from labioscrotal skin fibroblasts of 8 males and 26 individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) due to inactivating androgen receptor gene mutations. By this approach we identified differential methylation of 167 CpG loci representing 162 unique human genes. These were significantly enriched for androgen target genes and low CpG content promoter genes. Additional 75 genes showed a significant increase of heterogeneity of methylation in AIS compared to a high homogeneity in normal male controls. Our data show that normal and aberrant androgen receptor function is associated with distinct patterns of DNA-methylation marks in genital tissues. These findings support the concept that transcription factor binding to the DNA has an impact on the shape of the DNA methylome. These data which derived from a rare human model suggest that androgen programming of methylation marks contributes to sexual dimorphism in the human which might have considerable impact on the manifestation of sex-associated phenotypes and diseases.","1932-6203 Ammerpohl, Ole Bens, Susanne Appari, Mahesh Werner, Ralf Korn, Bernhard Drop, Stenvert L S Verheijen, Frans van der Zwan, Yvonne Bunch, Trevor Hughes, Ieuan Cools, Martine Riepe, Felix G Hiort, Olaf Siebert, Reiner Holterhus, Paul-Martin Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2013/09/12 PLoS One. 2013 Sep 4;8(9):e73288. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0073288. eCollection 2013.",10.1371/journal.pone.0073288,"Androgen-Insensitivity Syndrome/genetics/physiopathology;Androgens/metabolism;Apolipoproteins D/genetics;CpG Islands/genetics;DNA Methylation/*physiology;Epigenomics;Female;Fibroblasts/metabolism;Gene Expression Regulation/genetics;Genitalia, Female/cytology;Genitalia, Male/cytology;Genomic Imprinting/genetics;Humans;Male;Mutation;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics;Receptors, Androgen/genetics/*metabolism;*Sex Characteristics;Skin/cytology;Humanities;Humanism;Receptors, Androgen;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Virilism",,

In any given cell, the process of XCI in early female development is thought to be random across alleles and clonally maintained once established. Recent studies, however, suggest that XCI might not always be random and that skewed inactivation may become more prevalent with age. The factors influencing such XCI skewing and its changes over time are largely unknown. To elucidate the influence of stochastic, heritable and environmental factors in longitudinal changes in XCI, we examined X inactivation profiles in a sample of monozygotic (MZ) (n = 23) and dizygotic (DZ) (n = 22) female twin-pairs at ages 5 and 10 years. Compared to MZ twins who were highly concordant for allelic XCI ratios, DZ twins showed much lower levels of concordance. Whilst XCI patterns were moderately stable between ages 5 and 10 years, there was some drift over time with an increased prevalence of more extreme XCI skewing at age 10. To our knowledge, this study represents the earliest longitudinal assessment of skewed XCI patterns, and suggests that skewed XCI may already be established in early childhood. Our data also suggest a link between MZ twinning and the establishment of allelic XCI ratios, and demonstrate that acquired skewing in XCI after establishment is primarily mediated by stochastic mechanisms. These data have implications for our understanding about sex differences in complex disease, and the potential causes of phenotypic discordance between MZ female twins.","1932-6203 Wong, Chloe Chung Yi Caspi, Avshalom Williams, Benjamin Houts, Renate Craig, Ian W Mill, Jonathan G0601483/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom MH077874/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States R01 MH077874/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States G9806489/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom HD061298/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States G0100527/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom R01 HD061298/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Twin Study United States 2011/03/30 PLoS One. 2011 Mar 22;6(3):e17873. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0017873.",10.1371/journal.pone.0017873,"Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Humans;*X Chromosome Inactivation;X Chromosome;Twins",,

There were broad differences in transcriptomics, with >6000 (GA) and >4000 (SOL) mRNAs differentially-expressed by sex; only a minority of these were shared across GA and SOL.

The basis for this sex bias lies in the X chromosome, which contains many immunityrelated genes. Femalemammals use X chromosome inactivation (XCI) to generate a transcriptionally silent inactive X chromosome (Xi) enriched with heterochromatic modifications and XIST/Xist RNA, which equalizes gene expression between the sexes. Here, we examine the maintenance of XCI in lymphocytes from females in mice and humans. Strikingly, we find that mature naïve T and B cells have dispersed patterns of XIST/Xist RNA, and they lack the typical heterochromatic modifications of the Xi. In vitro activation of lymphocytes triggers the return of XIST/Xist RNA transcripts and some chromatin marks (H3K27me3, ubiquitin-H2A) to the Xi. Single-cell RNA FISH analysis of female T cells revealed that the X-linked immunity genes CD40LG and CXCR3 are biallelically expressed in some cells. Using knockout and knockdown approaches, we find that Xist RNA-binding proteins, YY1 and hnRNPU, are critical for recruitment of XIST/Xist RNA back to the Xi. Furthermore, we examined B cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disorder with a strong female bias, and observed different XIST RNA localization patterns, evidence of biallelic expression of immunity-related genes, and increased transcription of these genes. We propose that the Xi in female lymphocytes is predisposed to become partially reactivated and to overexpress immunity-related genes, providing the first mechanistic evidence to our knowledge for the enhanced immunity of females and their increased susceptibility for autoimmunity.",L609441019 2016-04-13 2016-04-27,10.1073/pnas.1520113113,RNA binding protein;ubiquitin;animal experiment;article;autoimmunity;B lymphocyte;chromatin;clinical article;controlled study;female;gene expression;genetic predisposition;human;in vitro study;investigative procedures;lymphocyte;male;nonhuman;priority journal;systemic lupus erythematosus;T lymphocyte;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome;Lymphocytes,,

In this report, we estimate the number of functional retrogenes on the lineage leading to humans generated by the high rate of retroposition (retroduplication) in primates. Extensive comparative sequencing and expression studies coupled with evolutionary analyses and simulations suggest that a significant proportion of recent retrocopies represent bona fide human genes. We estimate that at least one new retrogene per million years emerged on the human lineage during the past approximately 63 million years of primate evolution. Detailed analysis of a subset of the data shows that the majority of retrogenes are specifically expressed in testis, whereas their parental genes show broad expression patterns. Consistently, most retrogenes evolved functional roles in spermatogenesis. Proteins encoded by X chromosome-derived retrogenes were strongly preserved by purifying selection following the duplication event, supporting the view that they may act as functional autosomal substitutes during X-inactivation of late spermatogenesis genes. Also, some retrogenes acquired a new or more adapted function driven by positive selection. We conclude that retroduplication significantly contributed to the formation of recent human genes and that most new retrogenes were progressively recruited during primate evolution by natural and/or sexual selection to enhance male germline function.","1545-7885 Marques, Ana Claudia Dupanloup, Isabelle Vinckenbosch, Nicolas Reymond, Alexandre Kaessmann, Henrik Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2005/10/06 PLoS Biol. 2005 Nov;3(11):e357. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030357.

To test the impact of Xist RNA on X-linked gene silencing, we ectopically induced endogenous Xist by ablating the antisense repressor Tsix in mice. We find that ectopic Xist RNA induction and subsequent X-linked gene silencing is sex specific in embryos and in differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). A higher frequency of XΔTsixY male cells displayed ectopic Xist RNA coating compared with XΔTsixX female cells. This increase reflected the inability of XΔTsixY cells to efficiently silence X-linked genes compared with XΔTsixX cells, despite equivalent Xist RNA induction and coating. Silencing of genes on both Xs resulted in significantly reduced proliferation and increased cell death in XΔTsixX female cells relative to XΔTsixY male cells. Thus, whereas Xist RNA can inactivate the X chromosome in females it may not do so in males. We further found comparable silencing in differentiating XΔTsixY and 39,XΔTsix (XΔTsixO) ESCs, excluding the Y chromosome and instead implicating the X-chromosome dose as the source of the sex-specific differences. Because XΔTsixX female embryonic epiblast cells and EpiSCs harbor an inactivated X chromosome prior to ectopic inactivation of the active XΔTsix X chromosome, we propose that the increased expression of one or more X-inactivation escapees activates Xist and, separately, helps trigger X-linked gene silencing.",L607777351 2016-01-26 2016-02-02,10.1073/pnas.1515971113,protein;RNA;unclassified drug;X inactive specific transcript protein;animal experiment;article;cell death;controlled study;ectoderm;embryonic stem cell;epiblast stem cell;epigenetics;female;gene silencing;genetic variability;male;mouse;nonhuman;priority journal;sex difference;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation,,

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to confirm a role for XCI skewing as a potential explanation for the strong female preponderance seen in AITD. DESIGN: The design of the study was to screen XCI in the largest GD, HT, and control case-control cohort and family cohort to date and undertake a meta-analysis of previous AITD XCI reports. SETTING: The study was conducted at a research laboratory. PATIENTS: Three hundred and nine GD, 490 HT, and 325 female UK Caucasians controls, 273 UK Caucasian GD families, and a meta-analysis of 454 GD, 673 HT, and 643 female Caucasian controls were included in the study.

RESULTS: Skewed XCI was observed with GD [odds ratio (OR) 2.17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-3.30], P=2.1×10(-4)] and a trend toward skewing with HT (P=.08) compared with the control cohort.

M. and Doumbo, O. K. and Wellems, T. E. and Diallo, D. A.",,,,,"BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is important in the control of oxidant stress in erythrocytes, the host cells for Plasmodium falciparum. Mutations in this enzyme produce X-linked deficiency states associated with protection against malaria, notably in Africa where the A- form of G6PD deficiency is widespread. Some reports have proposed that heterozygous females with mosaic populations of normal and deficient erythrocytes (due to random X chromosome inactivation) have malaria resistance similar to or greater than hemizygous males with populations of uniformly deficient erythrocytes. These proposals are paradoxical, and they are not consistent with currently hypothesized mechanisms of protection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted large case-control studies of the A- form of G6PD deficiency in cases of severe or uncomplicated malaria among two ethnic populations of rural Mali, West Africa, where malaria is hyperendemic. Our results indicate that the uniform state of G6PD deficiency in hemizygous male children conferred significant protection against severe, life-threatening malaria, and that it may have likewise protected homozygous female children. No such protection was evident from the mosaic state of G6PD deficiency in heterozygous females. We also found no significant differences in the parasite densities of males and females with differences in G6PD status. Pooled odds ratios from meta-analysis of our data and data from a previous study confirmed highly significant protection against severe malaria in hemizygous males but not in heterozygous females. Among the different forms of severe malaria, protection was principally evident against cerebral malaria, the most frequent form of life-threatening malaria in these studies. CONCLUSIONS: The A- form of G6PD deficiency in Africa is under strong natural selection from the preferential protection it provides to hemizygous males against life-threatening malaria. Little or no such protection is present among heterozygous females. Although these conclusions are consistent with data from at least one previous study, they have not heretofore been realized to our knowledge, and they therefore give fresh perspectives on malaria protection by G6PD deficiency as an X-linked trait.","1549-1676 Guindo, Aldiouma Fairhurst, Rick M Doumbo, Ogobara K Wellems, Thomas E Diallo, Dapa A Intramural NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural United States 2007/03/16 PLoS Med. 2007 Mar;4(3):e66. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0040066.",10.1371/journal.pmed.0040066,"Alleles;Case-Control Studies;Child;Child, Preschool;Chromosomes, Human, X/genetics;Female;Genes, X-Linked;Genetic Diseases, X-Linked/*genetics;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/genetics;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency/*genetics;Heterozygote;Humans;*Immunity, Innate;Malaria/*immunology;Male;Mali/epidemiology;*Selection, Genetic;Sex Factors;Malaria",,

However, only a few single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the X chromosome have been found to be associated with diseases. Compared to the autosomes, conducting association tests on the X chromosome is more intractable due to the difference in the number of X chromosomes between females and males. On the other hand, X-chromosome inactivation takes place in female mammals, which is a phenomenon in which the expression of one copy of two X chromosomes in females is silenced in order to achieve the same gene expression level as that in males. In addition, imprinting effects may be related to certain diseases. Currently, there are some existing approaches taking X-chromosome inactivation into account when testing for associations on the X chromosome. However, none of them allows for imprinting effects. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a robust test, ZXCII, which accounts for both X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting effects without requiring specifying the genetic models in advance. Simulation studies are conducted in order to investigate the validity and performance of ZXCII under various scenarios of different parameter values. The simulation results show that ZXCII controls the type I error rate well when there is no association. Furthermore, with regards to power, ZXCII is robust in all of the situations considered and generally outperforms most of the existing methods in the presence of imprinting effects, especially under complete imprinting effects.","1469-5073 Zhang, Yu Xu, Si-Qi Liu, Wei Fung, Wing Kam Zhou, Ji-Yuan Orcid: 0000-0003-0866-4402 Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2020/04/03 Genet Res (Camb). 2020 Apr 1;102:e2. doi: 10.1017/S0016672320000026.",10.1017/s0016672320000026,"Algorithms;Chromosomes, Human, X/*genetics;*Computer Simulation;Female;*Genetic Association Studies;Genetic Testing/*methods;*Genomic Imprinting;Humans;Male;Models, Genetic;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;*X Chromosome Inactivation;X chromosome;association test;imprinting effects;inactivation;X Chromosome",,

One of the major shared features among AID is the predominance in the female sex which in some cases changes with the age at disease diagnosis. Numerous hypotheses have been formulated based on intuitive scientific backgrounds to justify this sex imbalance, i.e. sex hormones and reproductive factors, fetal microchimerism, other sex-related environmental factors, a skewing of the X-chromosome inactivation patterns, and major defects in sex chromosomes. Nevertheless, none of these hypotheses has thus far gathered enough convincing evidence and in most cases data are conflicting, as well illustrated by the reports on fetal microchimerism in systemic sclerosis or primary biliary cirrhosis. The present article will critically discuss the main hypotheses (loss of mosaicism, reactivation, and haploinsufficiency) that have been proposed based on findings in female patients with specific AID along with two additional mechanisms (X-chromosome vulnerability and X-linked polyamine genes) that have been observed in AID models. Further, recent data have significantly shifted the paradigm of X chromosome inactivation by demonstrating that a large number of genes can variably escape silencing on one or both chromosomes. As a result we may hypothesize that more than one mechanism may contribute to the female susceptibility to tolerance breakdown while the possibility that unknown factors may indeed protect men from AID should not be overlooked.","1873-0183 Selmi, Carlo Brunetta, Enrico Raimondo, Maria Gabriella Meroni, Pier Luigi Journal Article Review Netherlands 2011/12/14 Autoimmun Rev. 2012 May;11(6-7):A531-7. doi: 10.1016/j.autrev.2011.11.024.

Most human autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome (SS), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and multiple sclerosis (MS) have increased incidence and prevalence in females, but so far, sex differences and hormone therapy in spontaneous or chemical induced animal models of autoimmunity are not entirely clear.

Gender differences also exist in organ specific autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Crohn's disease and celiac disease. Nevertheless, other organ specific autoimmune diseases (i.e. ulcerative colitis) are seemingly characterized with similar prevalence in both males and females. The reason for gender differences in certain autoimmune diseases remains unknown, but may be attributed to sex hormone influence, fetal microchimerism, X chromosome inactivation, and X chromosome abnormalities. Sex hormones have been found to have immune modulating properties, as well as providing cellular protection following tissue damage in certain circumstances. Sex hormones also influence innate and adaptive immune cells, number of B and T cells, antigen presentation and cytokine secretion.

Using these novel data, we elucidate divergent versus common features of representative marsupial and eutherian DNA methylation. First, tissue-specific differential DNA methylation in koalas primarily occurs in gene bodies. Second, females show significant global reduction (hypomethylation) of X chromosome DNA methylation compared to males. We show that this pattern is also observed in eutherians. Third, on average, promoter DNA methylation shows little difference between male and female koala X chromosomes, a pattern distinct from that of eutherians. Fourth, the sex-specific DNA methylation landscape upstream of Rsx, the primary lncRNA associated with marsupial XCI, is consistent with the epigenetic regulation of female-specific (and presumably inactive X chromosome-specific) expression. Finally, we use the prominent female X chromosome hypomethylation and classify 98 previously unplaced scaffolds as X-linked, contributing an additional 14.6 Mb (21.5%) to genomic data annotated as the koala X chromosome.

We examined largely understudied aspects of early transcriptional events in DRG within 24 h after sciatic nerve axotomy in mice of both sexes. Using high-depth RNA sequencing (>50 million reads/sample) to pinpoint sexually dimorphic changes related to regeneration, immune response, bioenergy, and sensory functions, we identified a higher number of transcriptional changes in male relative to female DRG. In males, the decline in ion channel transcripts was accompanied by the induction of innate immune cascades via TLR, chemokine, and Csf1-receptor axis and robust regenerative programs driven by Sox, Twist1/2, and Pax5/9 transcription factors. Females demonstrated nerve injury-specific transcriptional co-activation of the actinin 2 network. The predicted upstream regulators and interactive networks highlighted the role of novel epigenetic factors and genetic linkage to sex chromosomes as hallmarks of gene regulation post-axotomy.

A. and Bourke, N. M. and O'Farrelly, C.",,,,,"Type I interferons (IFN-I) and their cognate receptor, the IFNAR1/2 heterodimer, are critical components of the innate immune system in humans. They have been widely explored in the context of viral infection and autoimmune disease where they play key roles in protection against infection or shaping disease pathogenesis. A false dichotomy has emerged in the study of IFN-I where interferons are thought of as either beneficial or pathogenic. This 'good or bad' viewpoint excludes more nuanced interpretations of IFN-I biology - for example, it is known that IFN-I is associated with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, yet is also protective in the context of infectious diseases and contributes to resistance to viral infection. Studies have suggested that a shared transcriptomic signature underpins both potential resistance to viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmune disease. This seems to be particularly evident in females, who exhibit increased viral resistance and increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease. The molecular mechanisms behind such a signature and the role of sex in its determination have yet to be precisely defined. From a genomic perspective, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFN-I pathway have been associated with both infectious and autoimmune disease. While overlap between infection and autoimmunity has been described in the incidence of these SNPs, it has been overlooked in work and discussion to date. Here, we discuss the possible contributions of IFN-Is to the pathogenesis of infectious and autoimmune diseases. We comment on genetic associations between common SNPs in IFN-I or their signalling molecules that point towards roles in protection against viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmunity and propose that a shared transcriptomic and genomic immunological signature may underlie resistance to viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmunity in humans. We believe that defining shared transcriptomic and genomic immunological signatures underlying resistance to viral infection and autoimmunity in humans will reveal new therapeutic targets and improved vaccine strategies, particularly in females.","1664-3224 Sugrue, Jamie A Bourke, Nollaig M O'Farrelly, Cliona Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review Switzerland 2021/12/18 Front Immunol. 2021 Nov 30;12:757249. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.757249. eCollection 2021.",10.3389/fimmu.2021.757249,"Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics/immunology;Autoimmunity/genetics/immunology;Disease Resistance/genetics/immunology;Female;Gene Expression Regulation/genetics/immunology;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics;Humans;Interferon Type I/*immunology/physiology;Male;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta/genetics;Selection, Genetic;Sex Characteristics;TYK2 Kinase/genetics;Toll-Like Receptor 3/genetics;*Transcriptome;Virus Diseases/*genetics/immunology;X Chromosome Inactivation;autoimmunity;genetics;infection;sexual dimorphism;type I interferons;viral resistance;Interferon Type I;Autoimmune Diseases;Genomics;Genome;Interferons",,

Males are 2.84 times more often admitted to the ICU and mortality is 1.39 times higher as a result of COVID-19. Various factors play a role in this, and novel studies suggest that the gene-dose of Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 7 could contribute to the sex-skewed severity. TLR7 is one of the crucial pattern recognition receptors for SARS-CoV-2 ssRNA and the gene-dose effect is caused by X chromosome inactivation (XCI) escape. Female immune cells with TLR7 XCI escape have biallelic TLR7 expression and produce more type 1 interferon (IFN) upon TLR7 stimulation. In COVID-19, TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is one of the pattern recognition receptors responsible for IFN production and a delayed IFN response has been associated with immunopathogenesis and mortality. Here, we provide a hypothesis that females may be protected to some extend against severe COVID-19, due to the biallelic TLR7 expression, allowing them to mount a stronger and more protective IFN response early after infection. Studies exploring COVID-19 treatment via the TLR7-mediated IFN pathway should consider this sex difference.

C.",,,,,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce type I interferon (IFN-I) during HIV-1 infection in response to TLR7 stimulation. However, IFN-I-signaling has been shown to play opposite effects in HIV-1 and SIV infection. TLR7-driven type I interferon production in pDCs is higher in women than in men due to the cell-intrinsic actions of estrogen and X-chromosome complement. Indeed, TLR7 is encoded on the X-chromosome, and the TLR7 gene escapes the X-chromosome inactivation in immune cells of women which express significantly higher levels of TLR7 protein than male cells. Following HIV infection, women have a lower viremia during acute infection and exhibit stronger antiviral responses than men, which has been attributed to the increased capacity of female pDCs to produce IFN-α upon TLR7-stimulation. However, a deleterious functional impact of an excessive TLR7 response on acute viremia in women has been recently revealed by the analysis of the frequent rs179008 c.32A>T SNP of TLR7. This SNP was identified as a sex-specific protein abundance quantitative trait locus (pQTL) causing a difference in the TLR7 protein dosage and effector function in females only. T allele expression was associated with a lower TLR7 protein synthesis, blunted production of IFN-α by pDCs upon TLR7 stimulation, and an unexpectedly lower viral load during primary HIV-1 infection in women.

The physiological and immunological mechanisms are fascinating and range from incomplete X chromosome inactivation of immune genes, a crucial role for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and regulation of both immune activity and ACE2 by sex steroids. From this flows understanding of why lung and other organs are more susceptible to COVID19 damage in men, and how their distinct immunological landscapes need to be acknowledged to guide prognosis and treatment.

S. and Pang, K. and Saffery, R. and Novakovic, B.",,,,,"Sexual dimorphism refers to differences between biological sexes that extend beyond sexual characteristics. In humans, sexual dimorphism in the immune response has been well demonstrated, with females exhibiting lower infection rates than males for a variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. There is also a substantially increased incidence of autoimmune disease in females compared to males. Together, these trends indicate that females have a heightened immune reactogenicity to both self and non-self-molecular patterns. However, the molecular mechanisms driving the sexually dimorphic immune response are not fully understood. The female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, as well as the male androgens, such as testosterone, elicit direct effects on the function and inflammatory capacity of immune cells. Several studies have identified a sex-specific transcriptome and methylome, independent of the well-described phenomenon of X-chromosome inactivation, suggesting that sexual dimorphism also occurs at the epigenetic level. Moreover, distinct alterations to the transcriptome and epigenetic landscape occur in synchrony with periods of hormonal change, such as puberty, pregnancy, menopause, and exogenous hormone therapy. These changes are also mirrored by changes in immune cell function. This review will outline the evidence for sex hormones and pregnancy-associated hormones as drivers of epigenetic change, and how this may contribute to the sexual dimorphism. Determining the effects of sex hormones on innate immune function is important for understanding sexually dimorphic autoimmune diseases, sex-specific responses to pathogens and vaccines, and how innate immunity is altered during periods of hormonal change (endogenous or exogenous).","1664-3224 Shepherd, Rebecca Cheung, Ada S Pang, Ken Saffery, Richard Novakovic, Boris Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review Switzerland 2021/02/16 Front Immunol. 2021 Jan 21;11:604000. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.604000. eCollection 2020.",10.3389/fimmu.2020.604000,"Age Factors;Animals;Autoimmunity;*Epigenesis, Genetic;*Epigenome;Estrogen Replacement Therapy;Estrogens/metabolism;Female;Gonadal Steroid Hormones/*metabolism/therapeutic use;Humans;*Immunity, Innate/drug effects;Male;Progesterone/metabolism;*Sex Characteristics;Sex Factors;Sexual Development;Testosterone/metabolism;cross-sex hormone treatment;epigenetics;innate immunity;pregnancy hormones;progesterone and estradiol;sexual dimorphism;Gonadal Steroid Hormones",,

The Ebola virus disease crisis in West Africa dramatically revealed the need for a rapid and strategic development of vaccines to effectively control outbreaks. Seven years later, in light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this need has never been as urgent as it is today. Vaccine development and implementation of clinical trials have been greatly accelerated, but still lack strategic design and evaluation. Responses to vaccination can vary widely across individuals based on factors like age, microbiome, co-morbidities and sex. The latter aspect has received more and more attention in recent years and a growing body of data provide evidence that sex-specific effects may lead to different outcomes of vaccine safety and efficacy. As these differences might have a significant impact on the resulting optimal vaccine regimen, sex-based differences should already be considered and investigated in pre-clinical and clinical trials. In this Review, we will highlight the clinical observations of sex-specific differences in response to vaccination, delineate sex differences in immune mechanisms, and will discuss the possible resulting implications for development of vaccine candidates against emerging infections.

C. and MacDonald, J.

Because MECP2 is subjected to X-inactivation, most affected individuals are female heterozygotes who display cellular mosaicism for normal and mutant MECP2. Males who are hemizygous for mutant MECP2 are more severely affected than heterozygous females and rarely survive. Mecp2 loss-of-function is less severe in mice, however, and male hemizygous null mice not only survive until adulthood, they have been the most commonly studied model system. Although heterozygous female mice better recapitulate human RTT, they have not been as thoroughly characterized. This is likely because of the added experimental challenges that they present, including delayed and more variable phenotypic progression and cellular mosaicism due to X-inactivation. In this review, we compare phenotypes of Mecp2 heterozygous female mice and male hemizygous null mouse models. Further, we discuss the complexities that arise from the many cell-type and tissue-type specific roles of MeCP2, as well as the combination of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous disruptions that result from Mecp2 loss-of-function. This is of particular importance in the context of the female heterozygous brain, composed of a mixture of MeCP2+ and MeCP2- cells, the ratio of which can alter RTT phenotypes in the case of skewed X-inactivation.

Using a novel pipeline on those data, we identified a decrease in the proportion of biallelically expressed X-linked genes during development, consistent with XCI. Moreover, we show that while the expression sum of biallelically expressed X-linked genes decreases with embryonic development, their median expression remains constant, rejecting the hypothesis of X dampening. In addition, analyses of a different dataset of scRNA-seq suggest the appearance of X-linked monoallelic expression by the late blastocyst stage in females, another hallmark of initiation of XCI. Finally, we addressed the issue of dosage compensation between the single active X and autosomes in males and females for the first time during human preimplantation development, showing emergence of X to autosome dosage compensation by the upregulation of the active X chromosome in both male and female embryonic stem cells.

However, differential sex chromosome dosage complicates genome-wide epigenomic assessments, and the X chromosome is frequently excluded from female-to-male comparative analyses. Using the X chromosome in the sexually dimorphic mouse liver as a model, we provide a general framework for comparing base-resolution DNA methylation patterns across samples that have different chromosome numbers and ask at a systematic level if predictions by historical analyses of X-linked DNA methylation hold true at a base-resolution chromosome-wide level. We demonstrate that sex-specific methylation patterns on the X chromosome largely reflect the effects of XCI. While our observations concur with longstanding observations of XCI at promoter-proximal CpG islands, we provide evidence that sex-specific DNA methylation differences are not limited to CpG island boundaries. Moreover, these data support a model in which maintenance of CpG islands in the inactive state does not require complete regional methylation. Further, we validate an intragenic non-CpG methylation signature in genes escaping XCI in mouse liver.

Since AR is located on the X chromosome, statistical analyses in women heterozygous for CAG-repeat lengths are complicated by X chromosome inactivation. We thus analyzed a sample of women that were homozygous for the CAG-repeat length (n = 77). Mixed-handedness in men was significantly associated with longer CAG-repeat blocks and women homozygous for longer CAG-repeats showed a tendency for stronger left-handedness. These results suggest that handedness in both sexes is associated with the AR CAG-repeat length, with longer repeats being related to a higher incidence of non-right-handedness.

The dominant screen has produced six mutant lines, including both suppressors and enhancers of variegation. All are semidominant and five of the six are homozygous embryonic lethal. In one case, the homozygous lethality depends on sex: homozygous females die at midgestation and display abnormal DNA methylation of the X chromosome, whereas homozygous males are viable. Linkage analysis reveals that the mutations map to unique chromosomal locations. We have studied the effect of five of the mutations on expression of an endogenous allele known to be sensitive to epigenetic state, agouti viable yellow.

For sex chromosomes, we demonstrate a pattern of obligate dosage sensitivity among evolutionarily preserved X-Y homologs and update prevailing theoretical models for SCD compensation by detecting X-linked genes that increase expression with decreasing X-and/or Y-chromosome dosage. We further show that SCD-sensitive sex-chromosome genes regulate specific coexpression networks of SCD-sensitive autosomal genes with critical cellular functions and a demonstrable potential to mediate previously documented SCD effects on disease. These gene coexpression results converge with analysis of transcription factor binding site enrichment and measures of gene expression in murine knockout models to spotlight the dosage-sensitive X-linked transcription factor ZFX as a key mediator of SCD effects on wider genome expression.

However, there is, at present, little evidence to suggest that most X chromosome-linked genes require such compensation. Another view - that X chromosome inactivation may be related to sex determination - is examined here. Consider a hypothetical DNA sequence regulating a major structural gene concerned with the determination of maleness. If this regulatory sequence occurs in both X and Y chromosomes and if its copy number in the Y chromosome is significantly greater than in the X chromosome, then the male-determining properties of the Y chromosome could be attributed to this higher copy number. On the other hand, if the Y chromosome has the same copy number of this sequence as the X chromosome, it is difficult to see how determination of two sexes would occur under such circumstances because XX and XY genomes would then be indistinguishable in this regard. Such a situation seems to occur in the human species with respect to the banded krait minor satellite, a repetitious DNA sequence associated with sex determination. This apparent difficulty may be resolved if X chromosome inactivation renders regulatory as well as structural genes nonfunctional and thereby brings about a significant reduction in the effective copy number of X chromosome-linked DNA sequences concerned with sex determination. It is suggested that X chromosome inactivation brings about, in this manner, a critical inequality between XX and XY embryos and that sex determination in humans is a consequence of this inequality. An analogous situation appears to exist in certain insects in which inactivation of a haploid set of chromosomes (and presumably, therefore, a 50% reduction in the effective copy number of most genes) is associated with maleness. If this line of reasoning is correct, it would suggest that sex determination may be the primary function of X chromosome inactivation.",L16209671 1986-04-02,10.1073/pnas.82.20.6947,"age;developmental genetics;embryo;female genital system;gene expression regulation;heredity;heterochromatin;human;male genital system;mammal;normal human;priority journal;sex determination;sex difference;theoretical study;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Chromosomes, Human, X;X Chromosome",,

However, the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory factors contribute to sex-specific valve fibro-calcification remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified inflammatory factors present in serum samples from AVS patients that regulate sex-specific myofibroblast activation and osteoblast-like differentiation. After correlating serum proteomic datasets with clinical and in vitro myofibroblast datasets, we identified annexin A2 and cystatin C as candidate inflammatory factors that correlate with both AVS patient severity and myofibroblast activation measurements in vitro. Validation experiments utilizing hydrogel biomaterials as cell culture platforms that mimic the valve extracellular matrix confirmed that annexin A2 and cystatin C promote sex-specific VIC activation to myofibroblasts via p38 MAPK signaling. Additionally, annexin A2 and cystatin C increase osteoblast-like differentiation primarily in male VICs. Our results implicate serum inflammatory factors as potential AVS biomarkers that also contribute to sexually dimorphic AVS progression by driving VIC myofibroblast activation and/or osteoblast-like differentiation.

We find that these marsupial genes are like their eutherian counterparts, with respect to sex differences in methylation of nuclease-insensitive (nonregulatory) chromatin. However, with respect to methylation of the nuclease-hypersensitive (regulatory) chromatin of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase locus, the opossum gene differs from those of eutherians, as the 5' cluster of CpG dinucleotides is hypomethylated in the paternal as well as the maternal gene. Despite hypomethylation of the 5' CpG cluster, the paternal allele, identified by an enzyme variant, is at best partially expressed; therefore, factors other than methylation are responsible for repression. In light of these results, it seems that the role of DNA methylation in eutherian X dosage compensation is to ""lock in"" the process initiated by such factors.

Sex-based respiratory differences are present at birth suggesting a strong genetic component. Our objective was to characterize early life sex-based genomic signatures determined by variable X-chromosome methylation in the airways. We compared male versus female genome-wide DNA methylation in nasal airway samples from newborns and infants aged 1-6 months (N = 12). We analyzed methylation signals across CpG sites mapped to each X-linked gene using an unsupervised classifier (principal components) followed by an internal evaluation and an exhaustive cross-validation. Results were validated in an independent population of children (N = 72) following the same algorithm. X-linked genes with significant sex-based differential methylation in the nasal airway of infants represented only about 50% of the unique protein coding transcripts. X-linked genes without significant sex-based differential methylation included genes with evidence of escaping X-inactivation and female-biased airway expression. These genes showed similar methylation patterns in males and females suggesting unbalanced X-chromosome dosage. In conclusion, we identified that the human airways have already sex-based DNA methylation signatures at birth. These early airway epigenomic marks may determine sex-based respiratory phenotypes and overall predisposition to develop respiratory disorders later in life.",L629315356 2019-09-20 2019-10-10,10.1038/s41598-018-23063-5,"CpG island;DNA methylation;epigenetics;female;genetics;human;immunology;infant;male;metabolism;newborn;nose mucosa;physiology;sexual characteristics;X chromosome;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA, B-Form;DNA, A-Form;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;Methylation;DNA",,

The transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome achieves dosage compensation between XX females and XY males and ensures equal expression of X-linked genes in both sexes. Although all mammals use this form of dosage compensation, the complex mechanisms that regulate XCI vary between species, tissues, and development. These mechanisms include not only varying levels of inactivation, but also the nature of inactivation, which can range from being random in nature to driven by parent of origin. To date, no data describing XCI in calves or adult cattle have been reported and we are reliant on data from mice to infer potential mechanisms and timings for this process. In the context of dairy cattle breeding and genomic prediction, the implications of X chromosome inheritance and XCI in the mammary gland are particularly important where a relatively small number of bulls pass their single X chromosome on to all of their daughters. We describe here the use of RNA-seq, whole genome sequencing and Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) genotypes to assess XCI in lactating mammary glands of dairy cattle. At a population level, maternally and paternally inherited copies of the X chromosome are expressed equally in the lactating mammary gland consistent with random inactivation of the X chromosome. However, average expression of the paternal chromosome ranged from 10 to 90% depending on the individual animal. These results suggest that either the mammary gland arises from 1 or 2 stem cells, or a nongenetic mechanism that skews XCI exists. Although a considerable amount of future work is required to fully understand XCI in cattle, the data reported here represent an initial step in ensuring that X chromosome variation is captured and used in an appropriate manner for future genomic selection.",L622398426 2018-06-05,10.3168/jds.2016-12490,animal;bovine;female;gene expression regulation;genetics;lactation;male;sex factor;udder;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome,,

In this study, we investigated the expression and function of the long noncoding RNA FTX (lnc-FTX), an X-inactive-specific transcript (XIST) regulator transcribed from the X chromosome inactivation center, in both HCC and HCC gender disparity. lnc-FTX is expressed at higher levels in female livers than in male livers and is significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues. Patients with higher lnc-FTX expression exhibited longer survival, suggesting that lnc-FTX is a useful prognostic factor for HCC patients. lnc-FTX inhibits HCC cell growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, lnc-FTX represses Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity by competitively sponging miR-374a and inhibits HCC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion. In addition, lnc-FTX binds to the DNA replication licensing factor MCM2, thereby impeding DNA replication and inhibiting proliferation in HCC cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that lnc-FTX may act as a tumor suppressor in HCC through physically binding miR-374a and MCM2.

However, in recent years, a plethora of discoveries have turned PLS3 into a highly interesting protein involved in many cellular processes, signaling pathways, and diseases. PLS3 is localized on the X-chromosome, but shows sex-specific, inter-individual and tissue-specific expression variability pointing towards skewed X-inactivation. PLS3 is expressed in all solid tissues but usually not in hematopoietic cells. When escaping X-inactivation, PLS3 triggers a plethora of different types of cancers. Elevated PLS3 levels are considered a prognostic biomarker for cancer and refractory response to therapies. When it is knocked out or mutated in humans and mice, it causes osteoporosis with bone fractures; it is the only protein involved in actin dynamics responsible for osteoporosis. Instead, when PLS3 is upregulated, it acts as a highly protective SMN-independent modifier in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Here, it seems to counteract reduced F-actin levels by restoring impaired endocytosis and disturbed calcium homeostasis caused by reduced SMN levels. In contrast, an upregulation of PLS3 on wild-type level might cause osteoarthritis. This emphasizes that the amount of PLS3 in our cells must be precisely balanced; both too much and too little can be detrimental. Actin-dynamics, regulated by PLS3 among others, are crucial in a lot of cellular processes including endocytosis, cell migration, axonal growth, neurotransmission, translation, and others.

The repeats expand both somatically and on intergenerational transmission and increased repeat numbers are associated with increased risk of disease and increased risk of further expansion. The mechanism responsible for expansion is unknown. Here, we show in a knockin mouse model of these disorders that somatic expansion is much less common in females than in males. We show that this is due in large part to the fact that expansions occur only when the repeat is on the active X chromosome. However, even when this is taken into account, expansions in females are still less common than expected. This additional gender effect is not due to a protective effect of estrogen, a deleterious effect of testosterone or to differences in the expression of the Fmr1 gene or a variety of X-linked and autosomal DNA repair genes. However, our data do suggest that a higher level of expression of genes that protect against oxidative damage in females may contribute to their lower levels of expansion. Whatever the basis, our data suggest that the risk for somatic expansion may be lower in women than it is in men. This could help explain the reduced penetrance of some aspects of disease pathology in women. The fact that expansion only occurs when the Fmr1 allele is on the active X chromosome has important implications for the mechanism of repeat expansion. Published by Oxford University Press 2014.

To characterize the rec(X) chromosome, dosage blots were done on genomic DNA from carriers of this rearranged X chromosome using a number of X chromosome probes. Results showed that anonymous sequences from the distal end of the long arm to which probes 4D8, Hx120A, DX13, and St14 bind as well as the locus for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) were duplicated on the rec(X). Mouse-human cell hybrids were constructed that retained the rec(X) in the active or inactive state.

These molecular studies confirm that the rec(X) is a duplication-deficiency chromosome as expected. In the inactive state in cell hybrids, STS and MIC2 (which usually escape X chromosome inactivation) were expressed from the rec(X), whereas G6PD was not. Therefore, in the rec(X) X chromosome inactivation has spread through STS and MIC2 leaving these loci unaffected and has inactivated G6PD in the absence of an inactivation center in the q26.3 → qter region of the human X chromosome. The mechanism of spreading of inactivation appears to operate in a sequence-specific fashion.

However, sex differences in the brain with health and disease are often overlooked in experimental models. Sex effects originate, directly or indirectly, from hormonal or sex chromosomal mechanisms. To delineate the contributions of genetic sex (XX v. XY) versus gonadal sex (ovaries v. testes) to the epigenomic regulation of hippocampal sex differences, we used the Four Core Genotypes (FCG) mouse model which uncouples chromosomal and gonadal sex. Transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of ~ 12-month-old FCG mouse hippocampus, revealed genomic context-specific regulatory effects of genotypic and gonadal sex on X- and autosome-encoded gene expression and DNA modification patterns. X-chromosomal epigenomic patterns, classically associated with X-inactivation, were established almost entirely by genotypic sex, independent of gonadal sex. Differences in X-chromosome methylation were primarily localized to gene regulatory regions including promoters, CpG islands, CTCF binding sites, and active/poised chromatin, with an inverse relationship between methylation and gene expression. Autosomal gene expression demonstrated regulation by both genotypic and gonadal sex, particularly in immune processes. These data demonstrate an important regulatory role of sex chromosomes, independent of gonadal sex, on sex-biased hippocampal transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles.

Utx (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat gene on X chromosome) is an escapee gene that encodes a demethylase specific for lysine 27 of histone H3, a mark of repressed chromatin. We found Utx to be expressed higher in females than in males in developing and adult brains and in adult liver. XX mice had a higher level of Utx than XY mice, regardless of whether they had testes or ovaries, indicating that the sexually dimorphic gene expression was a consequence of the sex chromosome complement. Females had significantly higher levels of Utx than males in most brain regions except in the amygdala. The regional expression of the Y-linked paralogue Uty (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat gene on Y chromosome) was somewhat distinct from that of Utx, specifically in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (high Uty) and the amygdala (high Utx), implying that the two paralogues may be differentially regulated. Higher expression of Utx compared with Uty was detected in P19 pluripotent embryonic carcinoma cells as well as in P19-derived neurons. This transcriptional divergence between the two paralogues was associated with high levels of histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation at the Utx promoter and of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation throughout the gene body, which suggests that epigenetic mechanisms control differential expression of paralogous genes.

Recent evidence suggests that the presence of two X chromosomes may underlie the female bias in pSS. However, the exact X chromosomal alterations on a single-gene level in pSS and their contribution to the female bias in pSS remain elusive. The objective of this study is to define the contribution of X-linked gene expression to pSS pathogenesis, focusing on minor salivary gland-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) which are critical players maintaining salivary gland homeostasis. Methods: Genome-wide, allele-specific expression profiling was performed using MSCs derived from female pSS subjects meeting 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria (n=4) and female control subjects with sicca symptoms but without clinical or laboratory features of autoimmunity (n=4). qRT-PCR of XIST (X-inactive-specific transcript) and quantitative immunostaining of H3K27me3 were performed to assess status of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in pSS and control MSCs. Protein localization was analyzed by quantitative immunofluorescence in pSS and control MSCs. Expression levels of IL4 were measured by qRT-PCR before and after MSC adipogenesis to assess the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs. Student's t-test (two-sample, unequal variances) was used to compare experiment versus control groups for statistical significance. Results: All pSS MSCs analyzed demonstrated marked skewing of X-linked genes that escape XCI (i.e. escapees), while all control MSCs exhibited balanced escapee expression (Fig. 1). Concomitantly, pSS MSCs showed decrease in XIST expression levels (P < 0.05) and reorganization of heterochromatic, silencing foci in the nucleus (P < 0.05), suggesting a global disruption in XCI maintenance (Fig. 2). The skewing in X-inactivation escape in pSS MSCs was accompanied by mislocalization of protein products encoded by the escapees as well as inflammatory differentiation of MSCs (P < 0.05), consistent with the hallmark features of inflammation and fibrosis in pSS salivary glands (Fig. 3). Conclusion: We discovered global skewing of X-linked genes in pSS but not control MSCs, and identified escapee skewing as a new mechanism underlying pSS pathogenesis. Given that XCI is a female-specific process, our data suggests that dysregulation of XCI escape contributes to the female bias in pSS.",L637274778 2022-02-23,10.1002/art.41966,endogenous compound;histone H3;interleukin 4;adipogenesis;adult;allele;autoimmunity;case report;clinical article;conference abstract;female;fibrosis;gene expression;genetic transcription;homeostasis;human;human cell;immunofluorescence;immunohistochemistry;inflammation;mesenchymal stroma cell;minor saliva gland;protein expression;protein fingerprinting;protein localization;quantitative analysis;real time polymerase chain reaction;salivary gland;statistical significance;X chromosome inactivation;Bias (Epidemiology),,

The availability of original and recurrent/regrown tumors from the same patient allowed testing of the prediction that recurrent/regrown tumors have identical genetic abnormalities as the original tumor sample. We used PCR amplification, from archival slide-extracted DNA, to allelotype microsatellite polymorphisms as an indication of clonality and confirmed this by X chromosome inactivation analysis in samples from women. Tumors from 33 of 49 (67%) patients with two or more specimens showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of at least one marker in at least one of their samples. Two patterns of LOH were observed. In pattern A in 14 of 33 (42%) of patients, the LOH pattern of the first tumor was preserved in the second recurrent sample, with some recurrent tumors also showing additional LOH. In these patients, the original and second tumors are presumed to arise from the same original clone with or without progressive accumulation of LOH. In pattern B [19 of 33 (58%) patients], LOH seen in the first tumor was not preserved in the second or subsequent tumors, as evidenced by retention of heterozygosity compared with the first tumor. The simplest explanation is that the second tumor, although still monoclonal, arises from another independently abnormal clone. This was confirmed by X chromosome inactivation analysis in all 11 women where this was informative. These results show that initial and recurrent tumors, of a benign tumor type, are frequently derived from separate independent clones. This suggests that either: (a) more than one abnormal clone is present from the outset though only one dominates; or (b) several clones arise independently at different times.

In this review, we will outline the current evidence on the interaction of sex chromosome abnormalities with schizophrenia, autism, ADHD and mood disorders.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 10 Total Times Cited: 10 Cited Reference Count: 75,10.18632/oncotarget.13962,schizophrenia;autism;ADHD;depression;gender;BIPOLAR AFFECTIVE-DISORDER;X-CHROMOSOME;TURNER-SYNDROME;Y-CHROMOSOME;Chromosome Aberrations;Sex Chromosomes,,

Due to the different karyotypes and the effects of X chromosome inactivation, females and males exhibit distinct methylation patterns on sex chromosomes; thus, it poses a significant challenge to normalize sex chromosome data without introducing bias. Currently, existing methods do not provide unbiased solutions to normalize sex chromosome data, usually, they just process autosomal and sex chromosomes indiscriminately. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that ignoring this sex difference will lead to introducing artificial sex bias, especially for thousands of autosomal CpGs. We present a novel two-step strategy (interpolatedXY) to address this issue, which is applicable to all quantile-based normalization methods. By this new strategy, the autosomal CpGs are first normalized independently by conventional methods, such as funnorm or dasen; then the corrected methylation values of sex chromosome-linked CpGs are estimated as the weighted average of their nearest neighbors on autosomes. The proposed two-step strategy can also be applied to other non-quantile-based normalization methods, as well as other array-based data types. Moreover, we propose a useful concept: the sex explained fraction of variance, to quantitatively measure the normalization effect.

Sex differences in metabolism, appetite, body composition, and fat deposition are contributing biological factors. Gonadal hormones regulate the development of many sexually dimorphic traits in humans and animals, and, in addition, studies in mice indicate a role for direct genetic effects of sex chromosome dosage on body weight, deposition of fat, and circadian timing of feeding behavior. Specifically, mice of either sex with 2 X chromosomes, typical of normal females, have heavier body weights, gain more weight, and eat more food during the light portion of the day than mice of either sex with a single X chromosome. Here we test the effects of X chromosome dosage on body weight and report that gonadal females with 2 X chromosomes express higher levels of GH gene (Gh) mRNA in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus than females with 1 X chromosome and males. Furthermore, Gh expression in the POA of the hypothalamus of mice with 2 X chromosomes correlated with body weight; GH is known to have orexigenic properties. Acute infusion of GH into the POA increased immediate food intake in normal (XY) males. We propose that X inactivation-escaping genes modulate Gh expression and food intake, and this is part of the mechanism by which individuals with 2 X chromosomes are heavier than individuals with a single X chromosome.

To test for sex differences in early-stage embryos, we separated male and female blastocysts using newly developed non-invasive sexing methods for transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein and compared the gene-expression patterns. From this screening, we found that the Fthl17 (ferritin, heavy polypeptide-like 17) family of genes was predominantly expressed in female blastocysts. This comprises seven genes that cluster on the X chromosome. Expression analysis based on DNA polymorphisms revealed that these genes are imprinted and expressed from the paternal X chromosome as early as the two-cell stage. Thus, by the time zygotic genome activation starts there are already differences in gene expression between male and female mouse embryos.

This sex bias can be attributed to the enrichment of genes on the X chromosome playing essential roles in the central nervous system and their hemizygous state on males. Moreover, as a result of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), most genes on one of the X chromosomes in female somatic cells are epigenetically silenced, so that females carrying X-linked variants are not expected to be so severely affected as males. Consequently, the knowledge about X-linked ID (XLID) in females is still scarce. Herein, we used extreme XCI skewing (≥ 90%) to predict X-linked variants in females with idiopathic ID. XCI profiles from 53 probands were estimated from blood and buccal mucosa through a methylation-sensitive AR/RP2 assay. DNA samples with extreme XCI skewing were then submitted to array-comparative genomic hybridization and whole-exome sequencing. Seven females (13.2%) exhibited extreme XCI skewing, a percentage significantly higher than expected for healthy females in our population. XLID-potentially related variants were identified in five patients with extreme XCI skewing, including one pathogenic rstructural rearrangement [der(X) chromosome from a t(X;2)] and four single nucleotide variants in NLGN4X, HDAC8, TAF1, and USP9X genes, two of which affecting XCI escape genes. XCI skewing showed to be an outstanding approach for the characterization of molecular mechanisms underlying XLID in females. Beyond expanding the spectrum of variants/phenotypes associated with ID, our results pointed to compensatory biological pathways underlying XCI and uncover new insights into the involvement of escape genes on XLID, impacting genetic counseling.",L2005371357 2020-07-08 2020-08-12,10.1007/s12035-020-01981-8,adolescent;adult;article;child;comparative genomic hybridization;controlled study;DNA methylation assay;DNA microarray;female;gene;gene identification;gene rearrangement;genetic variability;HDAC8 gene;human;idiopathic disease;intellectual impairment;major clinical study;NLGN4X gene;TAF1 gene;USP9X gene;whole exome sequencing;X chromosome inactivation;Intellectual Disability;X Chromosome,,

A.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L72174355&from=export,,,,"There is a striking male predominance in hematologic malignancies, as well as many solid tumors, but this sex bias is not understood. US males carry an age-adjusted increased risk of 20.4% for developing any cancer, and ≥2:1 male predominance for some cancer types. This risk leads to >150,000 excess new cases of cancer in US men annually. We sequenced DNA from blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), an aggressive leukemia with significant male predominance (>3:1 M:F). The splicing factor ZRSR2, located on chrX, had acquired loss-of-function mutations in ∼30% of BPDCNs, strikingly all from males (P<0.05 vs females). Somatic mutations in ZRSR2 also occur in 3-5% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which is a male-biased disease (1.6:1 M:F); 100% of previously reported loss-of-function mutations in MDS are in men (Yoshida et al, Nature 2011). These observations highlighted a conundrum. Although females have two X chromosomes (chrX), one copy is inactivated in all somatic cells. Therefore, mutations in chrX tumor suppressors should be equally likely in male and female cancers, because both have only one active copy of each gene vulnerable to a deleterious mutation. However, a small number of genes, including ZRSR2, escape X-inactivation in female cells and are expressed from both maternal and paternal alleles. We hypothesized that mutations in genes that escape X-inactivation could underlie a significant fraction of excess male cancers, as males would require only a single mutation while females would require two. For example, in our analysis, >50% of the excess male risk of BPDCN and 20% of the excess male risk of MDS are associated with ZRSR2 mutation. We termed these genes 'EXITS', for E scape from X -I nactivation T umor S uppressors. A previous study in T-ALL identified KDM6A (UTX) as a possible EXITS gene (Van der Meulen, Blood 2015). To query for EXITS genes in an unbiased manner, we designed computational algorithms to test for male predominance of chrX loss-of-function alterations (SNV, InDel, or copy number loss) in >4100 cancers of 21 types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We discovered putative EXITS genes that were mutated more often in males than females (P<0.001, FDR<0.1), including ATRX, CNKSR2, DDX3X, KDM5C, KDM6A, and MAGEC3. The same approach identified no silent mutations on chrX with male bias, no mutations on chr7 (similar in gene content to chrX) with a male bias, and no mutations on chrX with female bias. Overall, male-predominant loss-of-function mutations were enriched in genes that have been shown to escape X-inactivation (P=0.011). In the case of ATRX, nearly all of the male predominance was seen in glioma, whereas the M:F mutation ratio in all other cancers was essentially equal. Strikingly, using RNA-seq data from the GTEx project we found that ATRX undergoes escape from X-inactivation in female brain but not peripheral blood. This suggests that ATRX escaping X-inactivation in female brain could provide protection against gliomagenesis, and that tissue-specific patterns of escape could influence sex biases between cancer types. A corollary to the EXITS hypothesis is that chrY loss will be more frequent in males who also have mutations in EXITS genes. ChrY harbors evolutionarily ancestral homologs of chrX genes, and chrX genes with Y homologs are more likely to escape X-inactivation. ChrY loss is commonly observed in a range of cancers. Age-related loss of Y is also frequent in non-malignant blood cells, is increased among tobacco users, and is associated with a higher risk for non-hematological cancer. ChrX genes with Y homologs had a male-biased mutation pattern compared to other chrX genes (P=0.018). We classified chrY copy number based on exome sequencing in 949 male tumors and found that cancers with loss of chrY were more likely to have loss-of-function mutations in chrX escape genes than those without loss of Y (30.2% versus 15.9%, P=0.016). Thus, tobacco use may disproportionately increase the risk of some cancers in males, as mutation of chrX genes that have Y mologs but escape X-inactivation would preferentially lead to complete gene inactivation in male cells that have lost chrY by virtue of smoking. In summary, genes escaping X-inactivation may provide protection from cancer in females, and a significant portion of the male predominance of certain cancers, including several hematologic malignancies, may be due to the overrepresentation of EXITS gene mutations in men.",L72174355 2016-02-08,,RNA;DNA;neoplasm;hematology;American;X chromosome inactivation;human;male;society;tumor suppressor gene;gene;mutation;female;risk;loss of function mutation;brain;hematologic malignancy;blood;protection;leukemia;gene mutation;allele;plasmacytoid dendritic cell;X chromosome;exome;tobacco;somatic cell;smoking;myelodysplastic syndrome;hypothesis;somatic mutation;tissues;glioma;genome;blood cell;indel mutation;tobacco use;gene inactivation;morality;algorithm;solid malignant neoplasm,,

Our results demonstrate that sex-specific selection and sex-specific recombination rates can generate, and are compatible with, the gene- and species-specific linkage patterns reported in the genomics literature.

Six genes were analyzed by qPCR in in vivo-derived embryos, which displayed similar sexual dimorphism. Ontology analysis suggested a higher global transcriptional level in females and a more active protein metabolism in males. A gene homolog to an X-linked gene involved in network interactions during spliceosome assembly was found in the Y-Chr. Most of the X-linked-expressed transcripts (88.5%) were up-regulated in females, but most of them (70%) exhibited fold-changes lower than 1.6, suggesting that X-Chr inactivation is partially achieved at the blastocyst stage. Almost half of the transcripts up-regulated in female embryos exhibiting more than 1.6-fold change were present in the X-Chr and eight of them were selected to determine a putative paternal imprinting by gene expression comparison with parthenogenetic embryos. Five (BEX, CAPN6, BEX2, SRPX2, and UBE2A) exhibited a higher expression in females than in parthenotes, suggesting that they are predominantly expressed by the paternal inherited X-Chr and that imprinting may increase the transcriptional skew caused by double X-Chr dosage.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 228 Total Times Cited: 227 Cited Reference Count: 37,10.1073/pnas.0913843107,gender;preimplantation;microarray;imprinting;X-inactivation;PATERNAL X-CHROMOSOME;Gene Expression,,

It is known that many complex diseases are sex-determined and X chromosome is expected to play an important role. However, only a few single-nucleotide polymorphisms on X chromosome were found to be significantly associated with the diseases under study. On the other hand, to balance the genetic effect between two sexes, X chromosome inactivation occurs in most of X-linked genes by silencing one copy of two X chromosomes in females and dosage compensation is achieved. A few association studies on X chromosome incorporated the information on dosage compensation. However, some of them require the assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and some need to specify the underlying genetic model. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel method for association by taking account of different dosage compensation patterns. The proposed test is a robust approach because it requires neither specifying the underlying genetic models nor the assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Further, the proposed method allows for different deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium between cases and controls. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method generally outperforms the existing methods in terms of controlling the size and the test power.

However, since the first case of sex skewing reported in 1991, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We reported herein that sex ratio is skewed in mouse IVF offspring, and this was a result of female-biased peri-implantation developmental defects that were originated from impaired imprinted X chromosome inactivation (iXCI) through reduced ring finger protein 12 (Rnf12)/X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) expression. Compensation of impaired iXCI by overexpression of Rnf12 to up-regulate Xist significantly rescued female-biased developmental defects and corrected sex ratio in IVF offspring. Moreover, supplementation of an epigenetic modulator retinoic acid in embryo culture medium up-regulated Rnf12/Xist expression, improved iXCI, and successfully redeemed the skewed sex ratio to nearly 50% in mouse IVF offspring. Thus, our data show that iXCI is one of the major epigenetic barriers for the developmental competence of female embryos during preimplantation stage, and targeting erroneous epigenetic modifications may provide a potential approach for preventing IVF-associated complications.","1091-6490 Tan, Kun An, Lei Miao, Kai Ren, Likun Hou, Zhuocheng Tao, Li Zhang, Zhenni Wang, Xiaodong Xia, Wei Liu, Jinghao Wang, Zhuqing Xi, Guangyin Gao, Shuai Sui, Linlin Zhu, De-Sheng Wang, Shumin Wu, Zhonghong Bach, Ingolf Chen, Dong-Bao Tian, Jianhui R01 CA131158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2016/03/10 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Mar 22;113(12):3197-202. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1523538113.

Genes subject to inactivation are not only silenced on the inactive X in females, but they are also inactivated on the Y chromosome in males. One of the genes subject to this unusual inactivation pattern is the synaptobrevin-like 1 gene (SYBL1). Previously we showed that its silencing on the inactive X and the Y allele involves DNA methylation. This study explores the molecular events associated with SYBL1 silencing and investigates their relationship. Promoter DNA methylation profiles were determined by bisulfite sequencing and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that chromatin on the repressed Xi and the Y alleles has underacetylated histories H3 and H4 and H3-lysine 9 methylation. In addition, the inactive X and the Y allele were found to have a condensed chromatin conformation. In contrast, the expressed allele shows H3 and H4 acetylation, H3-lysine 4 methylation and a less compacted chromatin conformation. In ICF syndrome, a human disease affecting DNA methylation, SYBL1 escapes from silencing and this correlates with altered patterns of histone methylation and acetylation. Combined, our data suggest that specific combinations of histone methylation and acetylation are involved in the somatic maintenance of permissive and repressed chromatin states at SYBL1. Although it is unclear at present how this allele-specific silencing comes about, the data also indicate that the epigenetic features of the 'Y inactivation' of SYBL1 are mechanistically similar to those associated with X-chromosome inactivation.",L35439431 2002-12-24,10.1093/hmg/11.25.3191,bisulfite;DNA;histone H3;histone H4;synaptobrevin;acetylation;allele;chromatin;conformation;controlled study;correlation analysis;DNA methylation;female;gene inactivation;gene repression;gene sequence;gene silencing;genetic analysis;human;human cell;immune deficiency;immunoprecipitation;male;molecular mechanics;priority journal;promoter region;review;sex difference;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;Alleles;X Chromosome,,

Eleven ACF were isolated from five female patients. From these ACF, 178 individual aberrant crypts (ACs) were obtained and assessed for clonality using a method based on X chromosome inactivation of the polymorphic X-linked human androgen receptor (HUMARA) gene. Ten ACF were found to be mixtures of monoclonal and polyclonal types. The HUMARA analysis indicated that almost all ACF were polyclonal lesions. Simultaneously, we investigated K-ras mutations in each AC. We found that seven of the ACF harbored the K-ras mutation; strikingly, this was concordant for all of the ACs from a single ACF. These results, by contrast to the results of HUMARA analysis indicate that ACF lesions are monoclonal. This discrepancy suggests that ACF are apparently polyclonal because of de novo methylation on the active X chromosome. To confirm this possibility, we investigated the methylation status of the X chromosome in male ACF using a competitive PCR assay. One hundred nineteen individual ACs were isolated from eight ACF derived from four male patients. A total of 47 of 119 (39%) of male ACs showed de novo methylation of the HUMARA gene. We found that six of the eight male ACF harbored the K-ras mutation, and this was concordant for all of the ACs from a single ACF.

Moreover, H3K27me3 foci are present in only 10-20% of cells and we observed biallelic expression of Tlr7 in p-DCs from wildtype mice and NZB/W F1 mice. Unlike in humans, mouse p-DCs do not exhibit sex differences with interferon alpha production, and interferon signature gene expression in p-DCs is similar between males and females. Despite the absence of Xist RNA from the Xi, female p-DCs maintain dosage compensation of six immunity-related X-linked genes.

Although RLIM/Rnf12 is detected mostly in the nucleus, little is known about how and in which cellular compartment(s) RLIM/Rnf12 mediates its biological functions. Here we demonstrate that RLIM/Rnf12 protein shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm and this is regulated by phosphorylation of serine S214 located within its nuclear localization sequence. We show that shuttling is important for RLIM to exert its biological functions, as alveolar cell survival activity is inhibited in cells expressing shuttling-deficient nuclear or cytoplasmic RLIM/Rnf12.

Although several sex differences in GABA-mediated responses are known to be dependent on gonadal hormones, few studies have dealt with sex differences detected before the critical period of brain masculinisation. In this study, we assessed GABA(A) receptor functionality in sexually segregated neurons before brain hormonal masculinisation. Experimental Approach Ventromedial hypothalamic neurons were obtained from embryonic day 16 rat brains and grown in vitro for 2 days. Calcium imaging and electrophysiology recordings were carried out to assess GABA(A) receptor functional parameters. Key Results GABA(A) receptor activation elicited calcium entry in immature hypothalamic neurons mainly through L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels. Nifedipine blocked calcium entry more efficiently in male than in female neurons. There were more male than female neurons responding to GABA, and they needed more time to return to resting levels. Pharmacological characterisation revealed that propofol enhanced GABA(A)-mediated currents and blunted GABA-mediated calcium entry more efficiently in female neurons than in males. Testosterone treatment did not erase such sex differences. These data suggest sex differences in the expression of GABA(A) receptor subtypes. Conclusion and Implications GABA-mediated responses are sexually dimorphic even in the absence of gonadal hormone influence, suggesting genetically biased differences.

These observations suggest that androgen and estrogen regulatory elements in a cis region may play a common role in sex differences in gene expression, but TSSD in gene expression may additionally be due to causal variants located in tissue-specific enhancer regions.",L629616968 2019-10-22 2019-10-25,10.1093/hmg/ddz090,androgen;estrogen;article;autosome;body mass;chromosome 20;controlled study;enhancer region;estrogen binding;expression quantitative trait locus;female;gene expression;gene expression level;genotype;human;human tissue;major clinical study;male;minor saliva gland;priority journal;regulatory mechanism;sex difference;single nucleotide polymorphism;tissue specificity;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Organ Specificity;Sex Characteristics;Gene Expression,,

There are three proteins that are essential for X-inactive specific transcript to function properly: scaffold attachment factor-A, lamin B receptor, and SMRT- and HDAC-associated repressor protein. In addition, the absence of X-inactive specific transcript expression promotes tumor development. During the process of chromosome inactivation, some tumor suppressor genes escape inactivation of the X chromosome and thereby continue to play a role in tumor suppression. A well-functioning tumor suppressor gene on the idle X chromosome in women is one of the reasons they have a lower propensity to develop cancer than men, women thereby benefit from this enhanced tumor suppression.

V.",,,,,"The main mechanism proposed for formation of homologous translocations/isochromosomes is mitotic and if this occurs in a chromosomally normal conceptus, mosaicism would be expected to be seen. The lack of mosaicism in published cases of rearrangement (REA) of mitotic origin might he explained by Under-detection due to the low level mosaicism for a normal line. Recently it was reported that sex-specific centromere instability in early embryogenesis leads to a female prevalence among individuals with mosaicism for pericentromeric rearrangements. To determine whether carriers of apparent non-mosaic homologous REA could be mosaics for a normal cell line, the sex ratio (male to female ratio) among carriers of balanced and unbalanced homologous translocations/isochromosomes was studied. This ratio was determined to establish if there is a female predominance similar to that seen in carriers of REA with mosaicism. In reviewing the literature, a female prevalence among fetuses with balanced homologous REA and among carriers Of unbalanced homologous REA detected prenatally, postnatally and in miscarriages was found. Overall, there were 48 males and 72 females in the collected sample, and this ratio differed significantly from the expected sex ratio of 1.06 (P = 0.0075). There is not a male prevalence among miscarried fetuses, there is no evidence of selection against males in the collected material of this study. The analysis of sex ratios in different variants of trisomy 13 with respect to ascertainment (prenatal diagnosis, miscarriages, liveborn) also does not support an intrauterine selection against males as a cause of a female prevalence among carriers of homologous REA. Thus the data presented in this paper suggests that a proportion of the carriers of balanced homologous REA may have mosaicism for a normal line. Since low level mosaicism for a normal line in a translocation carrier would alter his/her reproductive options, it can be recommended that molecular polymorphic analysis be applied to these cases. This would allow those resulting from meiotic formation to be distinguished from those resulting from postzygotic formation. This latter mechanism may indicate the presence of a mosaicism for a normal line, making further intensive karyotypic analysis advisable. However, additional studies of healthy carriers of homologous REA of chromosome 14 or 15 should not be done.

The methylation of Hpa II and Hha I sites in HPRT alleles on the active X chromosome was the same in all tissues. The consensus pattern includes hypomethylation of 5' clustered sites and extensive methylation of the 3' sequence. The striking feature of methylation of inactive X-chromosome alleles is nonuniformity and less extensive hypomethylation of the 5' cluster. Analysis of HPRT alleles reactivated in response to 5-azacytidine showed at least partial restoration of the consensus pattern. These observations indicate that methylation of housekeeping genes on the X chromosome is the same as that of autosomal ones and that the overall pattern and methylation of multiple sites within a cluster may cooperate to facilitate transcription. Furthermore, the fidelity of methylation of the active allele and the extensive drift in methylation of the inactive allele suggest that mechanisms involved in X-chromosome dosage compensation may be directed at the active rather than inactive X chromosome.","1091-6490 Wolf, S F Jolly, D J Lunnen, K D Friedmann, T Migeon, B R",10.1073/pnas.81.9.2806,"Alleles;Base Sequence;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Female;*Gene Expression Regulation;Humans;Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics;Male;Sex Factors;X Chromosome/*physiology;Humanities;Humanism;Methylation;Chromosomes, Human, X;Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase;X Chromosome",,

Importantly, UTX deletion not only accelerates lymphomagenesis, it also strongly promotes tumor progression. UTX-knockout tumors are more aggressive, showing enhanced brain dissemination and formation of blood vessels. Efnb1 is overexpressed in UTX KO tumors and can lead to such phenotypes. In human patients, lymphomas with low UTX expression also express high levels of Efnb1, and cause significantly poor survival.

We find that the downstream transcriptional changes in the testis resulting from the loss of MSYq-encoded transcripts involve upregulation of multiple X- and Y-linked spermatid-expressed genes, but not related autosomal genes. Therefore, this indicates that in normal males, there is a specific repression of X and Y (gonosomal) transcription in post-meiotic cells, which depends on MSYq-encoded transcripts. Together with the known sex ratio skew in favour of females in the offspring of fertile MSYqdel males, this strongly suggests the existence of an intragenomic conflict between X- and Y-linked genes. Two potential antagonists in this conflict are the X-linked multicopy gene Xmr and its multicopy MSYq-linked relative Sly, which are upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in the testes of MSYqdel males. Xmr is also expressed during meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), indicating a link between the MSCI and the MSYq-dependent gonosomal repression in spermatids. We therefore propose that this repression and MSCI itself are evolutionary adaptations to maintain a normal sex ratio in the face of X/Y antagonism.","Ellis, Peter J I Clemente, Emily J Ball, Penny Touré, Aminata Ferguson, Lydia Turner, James M A Loveland, Kate L Affara, Nabeel A Burgoyne, Paul S MC_U117532009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom MC_U117588498/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2005/08/10 Hum Mol Genet. 2005 Sep 15;14(18):2705-15. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddi304.

Several disorders are more common or severe in males (e.g., autism and schizophrenia) or in females (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and depression). We analyzed transcriptomic data from the mouse hippocampus of six inbred strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, DBA/1J, DBA/2J, and PWD/Ph) to provide a perspective on differences between male and female gene expression. Our data show that 1) gene expression differences in males vs. females varies substantially across the strains, 2) only a few genes are differentially expressed across all of the strains (termed core genes), and 3) >2,600 genes differ in the individual strain comparisons (termed noncore genes). We found that DBA/2J uniquely has a substantial majority (89%) of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are more highly expressed in females than in males (female-biased); 129/SvImJ has a majority (69%) of DEGs that are more highly expressed in males. To gain insight into the function of the DEGs, we examined gene ontology and pathway and phenotype enrichment and found significant enrichment in phenotypes related to abnormal nervous system morphology and physiology, among others. In addition, several pathways are enriched significantly, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), with 32 genes implicated in AD, eight of which are male-biased. Three of the male-biased genes have been implicated in a neuroprotective role in AD.

This approach compares one allele against the other in the same subject. AEI ratios ranged from 0.3 to 4 in prefrontal cortex, demonstrating the presence of strong cis-acting factors in mRNA expression. Analysis of CpG methylation in the MAOA promoter region revealed substantial methylation in females but not in males. MAOA methylation ratios for the three- and four-repeat pVNTR alleles of MAOA did not correlate with X-chromosome inactivation ratios, determined at the X-linked androgen receptor locus, suggesting an alternative process of dosage compensation in females. The extent of allelic MAOA methylation was highly variable and correlated with AEI (R2 = 0.5 and 0.7 at two CpG loci), indicating that CpG methylation regulates gene expression. Genetic factors appeared also to contribute to the AEI ratios.

In some cases (diseases of sex organs, diseases resulting from X or Y chromosome mutations), reasons for sex discrepancy are obvious, but in other cases no reason is apparent. Explanations for sex discrepancy of illness occur at different biological levels: molecular (e.g., imprinting, X-inactivation), cellular (sex-specific receptor activity), organ (endocrine influences), whole organism (size, age), and environmental-behavioral, including intrauterine influences. Autoimmunity represents a prototypical class of illness that has high female-to-male (F/M) ratios. Although the F/M ratios in autoimmune diseases are usually attributed to the influence of estrogenic hormones, evidence demonstrates that the attributed ratios are imprecise and that definitions and classifications of autoimmune diseases vary, rendering at least part of the counting imprecise. In addition, many studies on sex discrepancy of human disease fail to distinguish between disease incidence and disease severity. In April 2001, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences published Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter? (Wizemann T and Pardue M-L, editors). This minireview summarizes the section of that report that concerns autoimmune and infectious disease. Some thyroid, rheumatic, and hepatic autoimmune diseases have high F/M ratios, whereas others have low. Those that have high ratios occur primarily in young adulthood. Gonadal hormones, if they play a role, likely do so through a threshold or permissive mechanism. Examples of sex differences that could be caused by environmental exposure, X inactivation, imprinting, X or Y chromosome genetic modulators, and intrauterine influences are presented as alternate, theoretical, and largely unexplored explanations for sex differences of incidence. The epidemiology of autoimmune diseases (young, female) suggests that an explanation for sex discrepancy of these illnesses lies in differential exposure, vulnerable periods, or thresholds. Biologists have an opportunity to inform medical scientists about sex differences that explain different attack rates in specific diseases, and physicians offer biologists experiments of nature to test theories of sex.",L33015094 2001-11-13,10.1152/jappl.2001.91.5.2366,estrogen;hormone;autoimmune disease;autoimmunity;disease severity;environmental exposure;female;gene mutation;genome;human;male;priority journal;review;rheumatic disease;sex difference;X chromosome aberration;Y chromosome linked disorder;Genome;Rheumatic Diseases;Sex Ratio;Genomics,,

B.",,,,,"STUDY QUESTION: Does the X chromosome inactivation (XCI) of Klinefelter syndrome (KS)-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) correspond to female human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and reflect the KS genotype? SUMMARY ANSWER: Our results demonstrate for the first time that KS-derived hiPSCs show similar XCI behavior to female hPSCs in culture and show biological relevance to KS genotype-related clinical features. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: So far, assessment of XCI of KS-derived hiPSCs was based on H3K27me3 staining and X-inactive specific transcript gene expression disregarding the at least three XCI states (XaXi with XIST coating, XaXi lacking XIST coating, and XaXe (partially eroded XCI)) that female hPSCs display in culture. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study used hiPSC lines generated from two azoospermic patients with KS and included two healthy male (HM) and one healthy female donor. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In this study, we derived hiPSCs by reprograming fibroblasts with episomal plasmids and applying laminin 521 as culture substrate. hiPSCs were characterized by karyotyping, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, teratoma formation, and embryoid body differentiation. XCI and KS hiPSC relevance were assessed by whole genome transcriptomics analysis and immunocytochemistry plus FISH of KS, HM and female fibroblast, and their hiPSC derivatives. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Applying whole genome transcriptomics analysis, we could identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between KS and HM donors with enrichment in gene ontology terms associated with fertility, cardiovascular development, ossification, and brain development, all associated with KS genotype-related clinical features. Furthermore, XCI analysis based on transcriptomics data, RNA FISH, and H3K27me3 staining revealed variable XCI states of KS hiPSCs similar to female hiPSCs, showing either normal (XaXi) or eroded (XaXe) XCI. KS hiPSCs with normal XCI showed nevertheless upregulated X-linked genes involved in nervous system development as well as synaptic transmission, supporting the potential use of KS-derived hiPSCs as an in vitro model for KS. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Detailed clinical information for patients included in this study was not available. Although a correlation between DEGs and the KS genotype could be observed, the biological relevance of these cells has to be confirmed with further experiments. In addition, karyotype analysis for two hiPSC lines was performed at passage 12 but not repeated at a later passage. Nevertheless, since all XCI experiments for those lines were performed between passage 11 and 15 the authors expect no karyotypic changes for those experiments. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: As KS patients have variable clinical phenotypes that are influenced by the grade of aneuploidy, mosaicism, origin of the X chromosome, and XCI 'escapee' genes, which vary not only among individuals but also among different tissues within the same individual, differentiated KS hiPSCs could be used for a better understanding of KS pathogenesis.

Copy-number variations (CNVs) may impact the human genome by either affecting gene dosage or disturbing a chromosome structural and/or functional integrity. Methods: We performed a high-resolution CNV profiling to investigate the X chromosome integrity in cohorts of 269 fertile females and 111 women affected with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and assessed CNVs impact into functional and nonfunctional genomic elements. Results: In POI patients, we observed a 2.5-fold enrichment for rare CNVs comprising ovary-expressed genes, and genes implicated in autoimmune response and apoptotic signaling. Moreover, there was a higher prevalence of deletions encompassing genes that escape X inactivation, noncoding RNAs, and intergenic DNA sequences among POI females, highlighting structural differences between X chromosomes of fertile and POI females. Furthermore, we discovered a ~4% carrier incidence for X-linked disorders among fertile women.

Sex is a key factor which influences cancer susceptibility as many cancer types show sexual dimorphism in their incidence. The aim of this review was to summarize the germline genetic polymorphisms lying on the X-chromosome that have been associated with cancer susceptibility and to evaluate their possible implication in cancer-related sexual dimorphism. PubMed and Web of Science were searched using the terms “X-chromosome”, “polymorphism” and “cancer”. The literature review revealed 39 articles reporting 33 genetic variants in 22 X-linked genes as being associated with cancer risk. Most of these genes interact with each other in a direct or indirect way, as GeneMANIA software revealed, demonstrating the complication of the mechanisms through which they are involved in tumorigenesis. Polymorphisms in eight genes [androgen receptor (AR), fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13), forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), nudix hydrolase 11 (NUDT11), Shroom family member 2 (SHROOM2), transcription elongation factor A-like 7 (TCEAL7) and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1)] are reported to have a sex-specific association with cancer susceptibility, which might explain the sexual dimorphism of certain cancer types. All of the above eight mentioned genes, with the exception of L1CAM, exhibit differences in their expression pattern between breast tumor (sex-specific)/thyroid tumor (sex-influenced) vs. normal tissues according to our analysis using GENT2 software. Additionally, differences in breast or thyroid tumor compared with normal tissues were also observed in five genes analyzed with GENT2 software that were previously related to sex-influenced cancer according to literature. Finally, the present review points out the need for the development of appropriate free and user-friendly statistical software in order to reduce bias/errors in statistical analyses and overcome researchers'reluctance to include X-chromosome variants in their genetic-association studies.",L2018120319 2022-05-24,10.21873/anticanres.15706,"breast tumor;cancer risk;chromosome variant;complication;female;genetic association;genetic association study;genetic polymorphism;genetic susceptibility;genetic variability;germ line;human;human cell;human tissue;male;Medline;review;sex difference;software;systematic review;thyroid tumor;Web of Science;X chromosome;androgen receptor;blood clotting factor 13;cell adhesion molecule;endogenous compound;fibroblast growth factor;nerve cell adhesion molecule L1;Nudix hydrolase;tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1;transcription elongation factor;transcription factor FOXP3;Polymorphism, Genetic",,

Although there are sex differences in methylation of the locus in leukocytes, the methylation pattern in liver, where the gene is expressed, is essentially the same for loci on the active and inactive X chromosome. The lack of differences in methylation of active and inactive genes makes it unlikely that methylation within the locus has a role in expression of the Factor IX gene. These findings, along with the absence of clustered CpG dinucleotides within the Factor IX locus, suggest that functional differences in DNA methylation related to X chromosome dosage compensation may be limited to CpG clusters.

Three TBG-CDJ heterozygotes and one unaffected female, confirmed to be PGK heterozygotes for a polymorphic BstXI site, were analyzed. Only the CD female was shown to undergo selective inactivation by examining the BstXI site in amplified products after digestion with a methylation sensitive enzyme, HpaII. Among an additional eight informative females with TBG deficiency, one heterozygous female for TBG-PDJ shared this selective inactivation pattern. Moreover, the X-chromosome with TBG-C was suggested to be inactivated selectively from the linkage of PGK and TBG alleles recognized in eight of nine family members.

Chromosome X open reading frame 21 (CXorf21) escapes X-inactivation and is an SLE risk gene of previously unknown function. We undertook the present study to delineate the function of CXorf21 in the immune system as well as investigate a potential role in the sex bias of SLE and pSS. Methods: Western blot protein analysis, qPCR, BioPlex cytokine immunoassay, pHrodo™ assays, as well as in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments were employed to delineate the role of CXorf21 in relevant immunocytes. Results: Expressed in monocytes and B cells, CXorf21 basal Mrna, and protein expression levels are elevated in female primary monocytes, B cells, and EBV-transformed B cells compared to male cells. We also found CXorf21 mRNA and protein expression is higher in both male and female cells from SLE patients compared to control subjects. TLR7 ligation increased CXorf21 protein expression and CXorf21 knockdown abrogated TLR7-driven increased IFNA1 mRNA expression, and reduced secretion of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 in healthy female monocytes. Similarly, we found increased pH in the lysosomes of CXorf21-deficient female monocytes. Conclusion: CXorf21 is more highly expressed in female compared to male cells and is involved in a sexually dimorphic response to TLR7 activation. In addition, CXorf21 expression regulates lysosomal pH in a sexually dimorphic manner. Thus, sexually dimorphic expression of CXorf21 skews cellular immune responses in manner consistent with expected properties of a mediator of the X chromosome dose risk in SLE and pSS.","1664-3224 Harris, Valerie M Koelsch, Kristi A Kurien, Biji T Harley, Isaac T W Wren, Jonathan D Harley, John B Scofield, R Hal P30 AR073750/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States T32 AR007534/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States U19 AI082714/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States U54 GM104938/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) release IFN-α upon TLR7 and TLR9 ligation. With respect to the nine times higher incidence of SLE in women and the clinical use of synthetic TLR ligands as novel immune adjuvants, we analyzed IFN-α and TNF-α production in healthy human individuals. Blood samples were incubated with synthetic TLR7 and TLR9 ligands. In three independent groups (n1 = 120, n2 = 101, and n3 = 123), analysis revealed a capacity of female PBLs to produce significantly higher IFN-α levels after TLR7 stimulation (p1, < 0.0000001, p2 < 0.0000001, and p3 < 0.0001) compared with male PBLs. In contrast, no sex differences were evident after TLR9 stimulation. TNF-α production after TLR7 stimulation and also total pDC numbers were not different between females and males. X-inactivation escape of the TLR7 gene was investigated in monoclonal B cell lines and, independently, in pDCs after cell sorting and single-cell picking, indicating regular silencing of one TLR7 allele in females. Additionally, exogenous 17β-estrogen and estrogen receptor antagonism did not indicate a significant role on TLR7-induced IFN-α production. Our data reveal for the first time a profound sex-dependent pathway of TLR7-induced IFN-α with higher production in females. These findings may explain the higher prevalence of SLE in females and the reported decreased therapeutic efficacy of synthetic TLR7 ligands in male individuals.

Design: Case-control study. Participants: Four hundred sixty-eight Taiwan-Chinese patients with GD; 200 of these patients had GO, whereas 268 patients did not. Methods: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the HLA-A and HLA-C loci were genotyped. Main Outcome Measures: The Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test with Bonferroni correction were used. The odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by applying unconditional logistic regression with a 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Strong gender effects on the distribution of the SNPs were apparent: male GD patients carrying an A allele at rs2074503 in the PRR3 gene tended to avoid demonstrating GO (P = 0.008; OR, 0.450; 95% CI, 0.248-0.819), whereas female patients tended to show GO (P = 0.01; OR, 1.486; 95% CI, 1.098-2.012).

Analysis of the haplotype blocks of the SNPs rs2074505 (GNL1) and rs2074503 (PRR3) showed that haplotype HA1 was underrepresented in male GO patients (P = 0.004; OR, 0.418; 95% CI, 0.228-0.767), whereas HA-4 was underrepresented in female GO patients (P = 0.007; OR, 0.660; 95% CI, 0.490-0.895).

We have utilized this technique to evaluate the behavior of the single X chromosome in oocytes from XO female mice, providing the first observations on segregation of an achiasmate chromosome during mammalian female meiosis and its effect on the meiotic process. As has been described in other species, we found that the univalent chromosome could either segregate as an intact chromosome to one pole or divide equationally at the first meiotic division. Our results also indicate that the presence of a univalent chromosome causes severe meiotic disruption during mammalian meiosis, affecting the alignment and segregation of other chromosomes in the complement. Despite these meiotic abnormalities, the vast majority of oocytes from XO females were able to resume and successfully complete the first meiotic division. This is in contrast to previous studies of male mice with sex chromosome abnormalities where the presence of a univalent acts to arrest meiosis at metaphase of the first meiotic division. This sex-specific difference in the ability of a cell with a univalent chromosome to initiate anaphase suggests that cell cycle central differs between male and female meiosis and that monitoring of meiotic chromosome behavior is less efficient in the female. The combined use of immunofluorescence staining and FISH on intact oocytes has obvious application to the study of meiotic chromosome non-disjunction in the human female. Simultaneous study of the meiotic cell cycle, protein components of the meiotic apparatus, and chromosome-specific behaviors during mammalian female meiosis provides a new approach to defining age-related changes in the meiotic process that result in increased chromosome malsegregation.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 124 Total Times Cited: 127 Cited Reference Count: 31,10.1093/hmg/4.11.2007,x-chromosome;mouse;mice;survival;fetuses;Meiosis,,

METHODS: We created a cohort of genetically diverse XLAS male and female mice using the Diversity Outbred mouse resource and measured albuminuria, GFR, and gene expression. Using a quantitative trait locus approach, we mapped modifier genes that can best explain the underlying phenotypic variation measured in our diverse population. RESULTS: Genetic analysis identified several loci associated with the variation in albuminuria and GFR, including a locus on the X chromosome associated with X inactivation and a locus on chromosome 2 containing Fmn1. Subsequent analysis of genetically reduced Fmn1 expression in Col4a5 knockout mice showed a decrease in albuminuria, podocyte effacement, and podocyte protrusions in the glomerular basement membrane, which support the candidacy of Fmn1 as a modifier gene for AS. CONCLUSION: With this novel approach, we emulated the variability in the severity of kidney phenotypes found in human patients with Alport Syndrome through albuminuria and GFR measurements. This approach can identify modifier genes in kidney disease that can be used as novel therapeutic targets.","1533-3450 Takemon, Yuka Orcid: 0000-0002-3538-4409 Wright, Valerie Davenport, Bernard Gatti, Daniel M Sheehan, Susan M Letson, Kelsey Savage, Holly S Lennon, Rachel Korstanje, Ron Orcid: 0000-0002-2808-1610 WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom 202860/Z/16/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2021/05/29 J Am Soc Nephrol. 2021 Aug;32(8):1961-1973. doi: 10.1681/ASN.2020060777.

Previous studies of Drosophila melanogaster found a general paucity of male-biased genes on the X chromosome, although this is mainly limited to comparisons of whole flies or body segments containing the reproductive organs. To better understand the chromosomal distribution of sex-biased genes in various tissues, we used a common analysis framework to analyze microarray and RNA sequence data comparing male and female gene expression in individual tissues (brain, Malpighian tubule, and gonads), composite structures (head and gonadectomized carcass), and whole flies. Although there are relatively few sex-biased genes in the brain, there is a strong and highly significant enrichment of male-biased genes on the X chromosome. A weaker enrichment of X-linked male-biased genes is seen in the head, suggesting that most of this signal comes from the brain. In all other tissues, there is either no departure from the random expectation or a significant paucity of male-biased genes on the X chromosome. The brain and head also differ from other tissues in that their male-biased genes are significantly closer to binding sites of the dosage compensation complex.

One exception is the model where selection at the imprinted locus affects the sexes differently. We present two models of maternal inactivation with differential viability in the sexes, one with complete inactivation, and the other with a partial penetrance for inactivation. We show that, provided dominance relations at the imprintable locus are the same in both sexes, a globally stable polymorphism exists for a range of viabilities that is independent of the penetrance of imprinting. The conditions for a polymorphism are the same as in previous models with differential viability in the sexes but without imprinting and in a model of the paternal X-inactivation system in marsupials. The model with incomplete inactivation is used to illustrate the analogy between imprinting and dominance by comparing equilibrium bifurcation plots for fixed values of dominance and penetrance. We also derive a single expression for the dominance parameter that leaves the frequency and stability of equilibria unchanged for all levels of inactivation.

This review evaluates the role of the placenta in such strategies, focusing on (1) mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in gene expression, (2) the nature and extent of sexual dimorphism in placental gene expression, (3) sexually dimorphic responses to nutrient supply, and (4) sexual dimorphism in morphology and histopathology. The sex chromosomes contribute to sex differences in placental gene expression, and fetal hormones may play a role later in development. Sexually dimorphic placental gene expression may contribute to differences in the prevalence of complications such as preeclampsia, although this link is not clear. Placental responses to nutrient supply frequently show sexual dimorphism, but there is no consistent pattern where one sex is more responsive. There are sex differences in the prevalence of placental histopathologies, and placental changes in pregnancy complications, but also many similarities. Overall, no clear patterns support the hypothesis that females are more responsive to the maternal environment, or that males prioritize growth. While male fetuses are at greater risk of a variety of complications, total prenatal mortality is higher in females, such that males exposed to early insults may be more likely to survive and be observed in studies of adverse outcomes.

We aimed to distinguish genetic and hormonal regulators of sex differences in plasma lipid levels. Approach and Results - We assessed the role of gonadal hormones and sex chromosome complement on lipid levels using the four core genotypes mouse model (XX females, XX males, XY females, and XY males). In gonadally intact mice fed a chow diet, lipid levels were influenced by both male-female gonadal sex and XX-XY chromosome complement. Gonadectomy of adult mice revealed that the male-female differences are dependent on acute effects of gonadal hormones. In both intact and gonadectomized animals, XX mice had higher HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than XY mice, regardless of male-female sex. Feeding a cholesterol-enriched diet produced distinct patterns of sex differences in lipid levels compared with a chow diet, revealing the interaction of gonadal and chromosomal sex with diet. Notably, under all dietary and gonadal conditions, HDL-C levels were higher in mice with 2 X chromosomes compared with mice with an X and Y chromosome. By generating mice with XX, XY, and XXY chromosome complements, we determined that the presence of 2 X chromosomes, and not the absence of the Y chromosome, influences HDL-C concentration.

Here, we focus on the application of experimental mouse models that elucidate the influence of 2 components of biological sex - sex chromosome complement (XX or XY) and gonad type (ovaries or testes). These models have revealed that in addition to well-known effects of gonadal hormones, sex chromosome complement influences cardiovascular risk factors, such as plasma cholesterol levels and adiposity, as well as the development of atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension. One mechanism by which sex chromosome dosage influences cardiometabolic traits is through sex-biased expression of X chromosome genes that escape X inactivation.

Methylation levels were similar between younger (M = 22.7 years) and older (M = 46.1 years) participants, and stable across age. Age modified few associations of methylation levels with sex. MAOA genotypes modified few associations of methylation with sex and age. Higher methylation levels among women were not explained by genotype, nor interaction of genotype and sexual abuse. Findings were similar after adjusting for lifetime diagnoses of substance dependence (women = 24.3%; men = 34.2%). Methylation levels were higher among women who experienced sexual abuse than women who did not.

V. and Nakayama, T. and Engebrecht, J.",,,,,"During meiosis in the heterogametic sex in some species, sex chromosomes undergo meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), which results in acquisition of repressive chromatin and transcriptional silencing. In Caenorhabditis elegans, MSCI is mediated by MET-2 methyltransferase deposition of histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation. Here we examined the meiotic chromatin landscape in germ lines of four Caenorhabditis species; C. remanei and C. brenneri represent ancestral gonochorism, while C. briggsae and C. elegans are two lineages that independently evolved hermaphroditism. While MSCI is conserved across all four species, repressive chromatin modifications are distinct and do not correlate with reproductive mode. In contrast to C. elegans and C. remanei germ cells where X chromosomes are enriched for histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation, X chromosomes in C. briggsae and C. brenneri germ cells are enriched for histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation. Inactivation of C. briggsae MET-2 resulted in germ-line X chromosome transcription and checkpoint activation. Further, both histone H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation were reduced in Cbr-met-2 mutant germ lines, suggesting that in contrast to C. elegans, H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation are interdependent. C. briggsae H3 lysine 9 trimethylation was redistributed in the presence of asynapsed chromosomes in a sex-specific manner in the related process of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin. However, these repressive marks did not influence X chromosome replication timing. Examination of additional Caenorhabditis species revealed diverse H3 lysine 9 methylation patterns on the X, suggesting that the sex chromosome epigenome evolves rapidly.","1943-2631 Larson, Braden J Van, Mike V Nakayama, Taylor Engebrecht, JoAnne Orcid: 0000-0002-2733-7506 R01 GM103860/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2016/06/10 Genetics. 2016 Aug;203(4):1641-58. doi: 10.1534/genetics.116.191130.

Between 9 and 35 human/hamster hybrids that selectively retained the active human X chromosome were produced from the T cells of each woman and analyzed with an X-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism for which the woman in question was heterozygous. Exclusive use of a single X as the active X was seen in the T cell hybrids from 7 of the 16 women, identifying these women as carriers of X-linked SCID. Studies on additional family members confirmed the mutant nature of the inactive X and revealed the source of the new mutation in three families. To determine whether there were any laboratory characteristics that might differentiate the boys whose mothers were identified as carriers of X-linked SCID from those whose mothers were not, the clinical records of both groups were compared to each other and to a group of 14 boys with a family history of X-linked SCID.

We analyzed DNA methylation changes during reprogramming of male and female somatic cells and in resulting induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). At an intermediate reprogramming stage, somatic and pluripotency enhancers are targeted for partial methylation and demethylation. Demethylation within pluripotency enhancers often occurs at ESC binding sites of pluripotency transcription factors. Late in reprogramming, global hypomethylation is induced in a female-specific manner. Genome-wide hypomethylation in female cells affects many genomic landmarks, including enhancers and imprint control regions, and accompanies the reactivation of the inactive X chromosome. The loss of one of the two X chromosomes in propagating female iPSCs is associated with genome-wide methylation gain. Collectively, our findings highlight the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation at enhancers during reprogramming and reveal that X chromosome dosage dictates global DNA methylation levels in iPSCs. Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to iPSCs, inducing reactivation of the inactive X chromosome. Using genome-scale DNA methylation analyses, Plath, Pasque, and colleagues show that iPSCs adopt sex-specific differences in global DNA methylation that correlate with the presence of two active X chromosomes.

XIST is abnormally expressed in many sex-biased diseases. In addition, escape from XIST-mediated XCI and skewed XCI also contribute to sex-biased diseases. Therefore, its expression or modification can be regarded as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of many sex-biased diseases.

R. and Lockton, S.",,,,,"The X chromosome of Drosophila shows a deficiency of genes with male-biased expression, whereas mammalian X chromosomes are enriched for spermatogenesis genes expressed premeiosis and multicopy testis genes. Meiotic X-inactivation and sexual antagonism can only partly account for these patterns. Here, we show that dosage compensation (DC) in Drosophila may contribute substantially to the depletion of male genes on the X. To equalize expression between X-linked and autosomal genes in the two sexes, male Drosophila hypertranscribe their single X, whereas female mammals silence one of their two X chromosomes. We combine fine-scale mapping data of dosage compensated regions with genome-wide expression profiles and show that most male-biased genes on the D. melanogaster X are located outside dosage compensated regions. Additionally, X-linked genes that have newly acquired male-biased expression in D. melanogaster are less likely to be dosage compensated, and parental X-linked genes that gave rise to an autosomal male-biased retrocopy are more likely located within compensated regions. This suggests that DC contributes to the observed demasculinization of X chromosomes in Drosophila, both by limiting the emergence of male-biased expression patterns of existing X genes, and by contributing to gene trafficking of male genes off the X.","1879-0445 Bachtrog, Doris Toda, Nicholas R T Lockton, Steven R01 GM076007/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States R01 GM076007-06/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States R01GM093182/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States R01GM076007/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2010/08/14 Curr Biol. 2010 Aug 24;20(16):1476-81. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2010.06.076.

J. and Livingston, D. H.",,,,,"Females have a longer lifespan and better general health than males. Considerable number of studies also demonstrated that, after trauma and sepsis, females present better outcomes as compared to males indicating sex-related differences in the innate immune response. The current notion is that differences in the immuno-modulatory effects of sex hormones are the underlying causative mechanism. However, the field remains controversial and the exclusive role of sex hormones has been challenged. Here, we propose that polymorphic X-linked immune competent genes, which are abundant in the population are important players in sex-based immuno-modulation and play a key role in causing sex-related outcome differences following trauma or sepsis. We describe the differences in X chromosome (ChrX) regulation between males and females and its consequences in the context of common X-linked polymorphisms at the individual as well as population level. We also discuss the potential pathophysiological and immune-modulatory aspects of ChrX cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females and how this may contribute to sex-biased immune-modulation. The potential confounding effects of ChrX skewing of cell progenitors at the bone marrow is also presented together with aspects of acute trauma-induced de novo ChrX skewing at the periphery. In support of the hypothesis, novel observations indicating ChrX skewing in a female trauma cohort as well as case studies depicting the temporal relationship between trauma-induced cellular skewing and the clinical course are also described. Finally, we list and discuss a selected set of polymorphic X-linked genes, which are frequent in the population and have key regulatory or metabolic functions in the innate immune response and, therefore, are primary candidates for mediating sex-biased immune responses. We conclude that sex-related differences in a variety of disease processes including the innate inflammatory response to injury and infection may be related to the abundance of X-linked polymorphic immune-competent genes, differences in ChrX regulation, and inheritance patterns between the sexes and the presence of X-linked cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females.","1664-3224 Spolarics, Zoltan Peña, Geber Qin, Yong Donnelly, Robert J Livingston, David H R01 GM118602/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Switzerland 2017/11/29 Front Immunol. 2017 Nov 13;8:1455. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01455. eCollection 2017.",10.3389/fimmu.2017.01455,X chromosome inactivation;X chromosome skewing;cellular mosaicism;infection;injury;sepsis;sexual dimorphism;Tocopherols,,

However, the general mechanisms of folding the genome into TADs are not fully understood. Here we test the effects of deleting a CTCF-rich locus on TAD boundary formation. Using genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), we focus on one TAD boundary on chromosome X harboring ~ 15 CTCF binding sites and located at the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) locus Firre. Specifically, this TAD boundary is invariant across evolution, tissues, and temporal dynamics of X-chromosome inactivation. We demonstrate that neither the deletion of this locus nor the ectopic insertion of Firre cDNA or its ectopic expression are sufficient to alter TADs in a sex-specific or allele-specific manner. In contrast, Firre's deletion disrupts the chromatin super-loop formation of the inactive X-chromosome.

We found that female human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) display reduced X-linked gene expression before entering meiosis. Moreover, in hPGCs, both X chromosomes are active and express the long non-coding RNAs X active coating transcript (XACT) and X inactive specific transcript (XIST)—the master regulator of XCI—which are silenced after entry into meiosis. We find that XACT is a hPGC marker, describe XCD associated with XIST expression in hPGCs and suggest that XCD evolved in humans to regulate X-linked genes in pre-implantation embryos and PGCs.

Most females are mosaics, having a mixture of cells expressing either their mother's or father's X-linked genes. Often, cell mosaicism is advantageous, ameliorating the deleterious effects of X-linked mutations and contributing to physiological diversity.

Evaluation of parent-specific gene expression revealed a minor increase in paternal expression at the 4-cell stage that increased at the 8-cell stage. We also detected eight genes with allelic expression bias that may have an important role in early development, notably NANOGNB. The main actor in X-chromosome inactivation, XIST, was significantly upregulated at the 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages in female embryos, with high expression at the latter.

As part of this question we asked whether mouse X-Y homologous gene pairs are expressed in brain in a sex-specific fashion. Using RT-PCR and northern blot analysis, we assessed mRNA expression in brain of eight Y-linked genes as well as their X-linked homologues, at three ages: 13.5 days post coitum, the day of birth (P1) and adult. Transcripts of six Y genes were expressed at one or more ages: Usp9y, Ube1y, Smcy, Eif2s3y, Uty and Dby. Their expression also occurred in XY female brain, and therefore does not require testicular secretions. Six X-linked homologues (Usp9x, Ube1x, Smcx, Eif2s3x, Utx and Dbx) were also expressed in brain, and in adulthood all of these transcripts were expressed at significantly higher levels in brains of females than in brains of males, irrespective of their X-inactivation status.

Three X-Y gene pairs, Usp9x/y, Ube1x/y and Eif2s3x/y, appeared to be differentially regulated (expressed in brain in a different age- or tissue-dependent pattern), and hence may not be functionally equivalent.

Immunofluorescence studies showed that soon after Xist RNA coating the inactive X (Xi) undergoes many heterochromatic changes, including the acquisition of H3K27me3. However, the mechanisms that lead to the establishment of heterochromatin remain unclear. We first analyze chromatin changes by ChIP-chip, as well as RNA expression, around the X-inactivation center (Xic) in female and male ES cells, and their day 4 and 10 differentiated derivatives. A dynamic epigenetic landscape is observed within the Xic locus. Tsix repression is accompanied by deposition of H3K27me3 at its promoter during differentiation of both female and male cells. However, only in female cells does an active epigenetic landscape emerge at the Xist locus, concomitant with high Xist expression. Several regions within and around the Xic show unsuspected chromatin changes, and we define a series of unusual loci containing highly enriched H3K27me3. Genomewide ChIP-seq analyses show a female-specific quantitative increase of H3K27me3 across the X chromosome as XCI proceeds in differentiating female ES cells. Using female ES cells with nonrandom XCI and polymorphic X chromosomes, we demonstrate that this increase is specific to the Xi by allele-specific SNP mapping of the ChIP-seq tags. H3K27me3 becomes evenly associated with the Xi in a chromosome-wide fashion. A selective and robust increase of H3K27me3 and concomitant decrease in H3K4me3 is observed over active genes. This indicates that deposition of H3K27me3 during XCI is tightly associated with the act of silencing of individual genes across the Xi. © 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",L355049283 2009-09-21,10.1101/gr.092643.109,DNA;histone H3;lysine;RNA;allele;animal cell;article;cell culture;cell differentiation;chromatin immunoprecipitation;embryonic stem cell;epigenetics;female;fluorescence in situ hybridization;gene;gene assignment;gene expression;gene repression;gene silencing;heterochromatin;immunofluorescence;male;microarray analysis;mouse;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;priority journal;promoter region;protein expression;quantitative analysis;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;sex difference;tsix gene;X chromosome inactivation;xist gene,,

We previously studied two female patients with HSD10 deficiency, one of them was severely affected and the other presented a mild phenotype. To elucidate as to why these two carriers were so differently affected, cDNA analyses were performed. The HSD17B10 cDNA of eight control cell lines, two hemizygous patients and two carriers was obtained from cultured fibroblasts, amplified by PCR and sequenced by standard methods. All HSD17B10 cDNAs were quantified by real-time PCR. In the fibroblasts of the female patient who presented with the severe phenotype, only the mutant allele was identified in the cDNA sequence, which was further confirmed by relative quantification (RQ) of HSD17B10 cDNA. This is in agreement with an unfavourable X-inactivation. The other female patient, with slight clinical affectation, showed the presence of both mutant and wild-type alleles in the cDNA sequence, which was confirmed by RQ of HSD17B10 cDNA in fibroblasts. This is in line with normal X-inactivation and the expression of both alleles in different cells (functional mosaicism). RQ results of HSD17B10 cDNA did not differ significantly between male and female controls, which indicate that the genetic doses of mRNA of HSD17B10 was the same in both sexes.

We found that mESCs grown in a ground state 2i condition displayed transcriptomic profiles diffused from preimplantation mouse embryonic cells, whereas EpiStem cells closely resembled the post-implantation epiblast. Sex-related gene expression varied greatly across distinct developmental states. We also identified novel markers that were highly enriched in each developmental state.

Importantly, we ""digitalized"" XCI progression using allelic expression of active and inactive X Chromosomes and surprisingly found that XCI states exhibited profound variability in each developmental state, including the 2i condition. XCI progression was not tightly synchronized with loss of pluripotency and increase of differentiation at the single-cell level, although these processes were globally correlated. In addition, highly expressed genes, including core pluripotency factors, were in general biallelically expressed.

We were interested in the level of NTD to correlate variables with primary neurulation versus secondary neurulation (canalisation) defects. 299 (57%) of our cases were primary neurulation defects (ie, had cranial or vertebral defects above T12) and 230 (43%) were secondary neurulation or canalisation defects (ie, had no recognisable vertebral defect above L1). The cases were also distinguished by presence or absence of additional congenital anomalies. 20% of the primary neurulation defects had additional congenital anomalies, while there was no increase in congenital anomalies among the canalisation defect group. The M/F sex ratio for all isolated NTDs (ie, without additional anomalies), including both neurulation and canalisation defects, was 0.83, while that of all NTDs with additional anomalies was 1.2. The sex ratio for isolated cases of all primary neurulation defects was 0.65. The sex ratio for all other categories of NTDs (except the very small group of multiple neural tube defects with anomalies) was greater than or close to 1.0 or had been skewed away from 1.0 by having isolated primary NTDs within the category. Thus our data resemble those of Martinez Frias et al. We did not find the excess of females only in the group of NTDs with abnormal thoracic and cervical vertebrae which Seller observed in her pathological specimens; in our clinic population there was an excess of females among isolated primary neurulation defects of all types. This difference may be related to the fact that most of our cases were term deliveries or liveborn rather than terminations. Seller and James have suggested that female embryos develop more slowly than males, making them susceptible to failure of proper neural tube formation. We would like to suggest that some component of the slower early embryological development seen in females may be secondary to delayed X inactivation, of some or all of an X chromosome in some or all of the cells of the female embryos with NTDs. Late inactivation would make those cells in the developing embryo aneuploid with regard to the X chromosome by virtue of having two active X chromosomes. A variety of human aneuploidies predispose to NTDs. Aneuploid cells would be expected to divide more slowly than normal (eg, more slowly than male cells or female cells which have completed normal inactivation of one X). A slower rate of cell division and tissue growth would be expected to predispose to failure of neural tube closure (primary neurulation). This hypothesis should be testable in mice with appropriate X chromosome markers to demonstrate X inactivation or lack thereof in early embryo development.",L17177886 1987-01-21,,central nervous system;clinical article;congenital disorder;etiology;heredity;human;neural tube defect;priority journal;sex;sex difference;sex ratio;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Neural Tube Defects;Sex Ratio,,

In early mouse development, however, selective inactivation of X(P) occurs first in extraembryonic lineages at the blastocyst stage around the time of implantation before later random inactivation in the embryonic ectoderm from which the fetus is derived. Xist, a gene mapping to the X-inactivation centre (Xic), is exclusively expressed from the inactive X-chromosome and is thought to be involved in the initiation of X-inactivation. Consistent with this, Xist is first expressed at the 4-to 8-cell stages, prior to functional inactivation at the blastocyst stage, exclusively from X(P) in female embryos. This also suggests that genomic imprinting may influence the earliest expression of Xist resulting in selective inactivation of X(P) and a candidate methylation site in the promoter region has recently been described. Here we report the expression of the human homologue, XIST, in human preimplantation embryos from the 5- to 10-cell stage onwards consistent with its role in the initiation of inactivation.

In fact, cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in both women and men. Although female sex does appear to be associated with cardioprotection, aging and menopause are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In fact, specific cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, occur more frequently in women than men by a proportion of 2:11. As our current population ages, the number of women living with cardiovascular disease is ever increasing, imposing a major economic burden on global health care systems. Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of gender on disease progression, pharmacogenomics, therapeutic and environmental responses may allow for the development of gender-specific therapeutics. Aging is associated with a reduced capacity for the heart to repair itself. Since stem cells aid in mediating endogenous repair, cardiovascular disease might be, in part, a failure of stemcell mediated cardiac repair. Indeed, we found that as both men and women age, there is a decrease in the frequency of blood circulating stem cells that express the stem cell marker, CD34 which differs between the sexes, decreasing at a much earlier age in males than females. This is mimicked in animal models of atherosclerotic disease where a sexdifference decrease in CD34+ cells with age is inversely correlated with progression of disease. These cells play an important role in mediating new blood vessel growth after myocardial ischemic episodes due to coronary artery disease. Aging is also associated with altered inflammatory responses, and patients with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease development demonstrate a significant increase in inflammation. Sex differences in inflammation also exist and the functionality of progenitor cells is higher in middle-aged women than in middle-aged men. In fact, we found that delivery of female reparative inflammatory cells into male mice having atherosclerotic disease, results in an increase in male reparative cell number and response suggesting that female inflammatory cells may confer protection. Indeed, we found that stem cells from female mice exposed to ischemia, exhibit decreased apoptosis, decreased cytokines and growth factors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Other studies have shown that female stem cells offer greater protection after ischemia/reperfusion injury than do male cells. Clinical studies have shown that hearts from women are protected against ischemia/ reperfusion injury with a decrease in TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 inflammatory cytokines. The heart itself may also differ in men and women. For example, during pregnancy women must functionally compensate for an increase in blood volume and for rapid reduction in blood volume after delivery. The inability to compensate for these changes can cause heart failure associated pregnancy2. Interestingly, we have found that extracellular matrix of female hearts is actually stiffer than male hearts which may be related to genderspecific hormones. Indeed, administration of estrogen limits undesirable extracellular matrix remodeling in blood volume overloaded hearts3. The mechanisms for these sex differences are unclear. Since menopause is a major risk factor cardiovascular disease development, it is postulated that hormones such as estrogen play an important role in mediating these sex differences. However, the use and efficacy of replacement hormone therapy in post-menopausal women has proven controversial and in some trials, ineffective reducing the incidence of disease. This suggests that gender-specific hormones may not be the only mechanism for sex differences in disease outcomes. Interestingly, prepubescent male and female children also have differences in their inflammatory cytokine responses suggesting th t the X chromosome, itself and genes escaping X chromosome inactivation may contribute to sex differences. A greater understanding of sex differences in cardiovascular disease will inevitably lead to therapeutics limiting disease progression and decreasing mortality for women.",L71386992 2014-04-04,10.1097/01.gme.0000435159.65865.11,interleukin 6;hormone;estrogen;cytokine;vasculotropin;tumor necrosis factor;growth factor;interleukin 1;cell marker;menopause;society;sex difference;female;human;male;cardiovascular disease;stem cell;heart;disease course;inflammation;aging;risk factor;blood volume;gender;protection;therapy;extracellular matrix;inflammatory cell;middle aged;mouse;blood;pharmacogenomics;apoptosis;cause of death;ischemia;heart protection;mortality;cell count;gene;X chromosome;health care system;patient;injury;hormonal therapy;population;coronary artery disease;blood vessel;heart failure;animal model;pregnancy;reperfusion injury;girl;cytokine response;clinical study;X chromosome inactivation;heart failure with preserved ejection fraction;health;Sex Characteristics,,

Recent work suggests that the epigenetic process of X-inactivation in female individuals may impact on intelligence and child behavioral problems. The timing of X-inactivation has been linked to chorionic splitting in MZ twins. Dichorionic monozygotic (DC-MZ) twinning, unlike monochorionic monozygotic (MC-MZ) twinning, occurs prior to the time of X-inactivation in female organisms. Therefore, the hypothesis of a causal role of X-inactivation in intelligence and behavioral problems can be analyzed by modeling the statistical interaction between sex and chorion type for within-pair differences in these traits in MZ twins. In this study, the effect of X-inactivation on childhood behavioral problems, measured with the CBCL, was studied in a sample of 324 MZ twin pairs from the EFPTS and the effect of X-inactivation on IQ was studied in a sample of 272 twin pairs from the same twin survey. Information on chorion type, gestational age, and birth weight was additionally collated. No significant statistical interaction was found between sex and chorion type, indicating that X-inactivation is not likely involved in variations in intelligence or behavioral problems in middle childhood.

Here, we report that a major target of H1-mediated regulation in embryonic stem (ES) cells is the X-linked Rhox homeobox gene cluster. To address the underlying mechanism, we examined the founding member of the Rhox gene cluster-Rhox5-and found that its distal promoter (Pd) loses H1, undergoes demethylation, and is transcriptionally activated in response to loss of H1 genes in ES cells. Demethylation of the Pd is required for its transcriptional induction and we identified a single cytosine in the Pd that, when methylated, is sufficient to inhibit Pd transcription. Methylation of this single cytosine prevents the Pd from binding GA-binding protein (GABP), a transcription factor essential for Pd transcription. Thus, H1 silences Rhox5 transcription by promoting methylation of one of its promoters, a mechanism likely to extend to other H1-regulated Rhox genes, based on analysis of ES cells lacking DNA methyltransferases. The Rhox cluster genes targeted for H1-mediated transcriptional repression are also subject to another DNA methylation-regulated process: Xp imprinting. Remarkably, we found that only H1-regulated Rhox genes are imprinted, not those immune to H1-mediated repression. Together, our results indicate that the Rhox gene cluster is a major target of H1-mediated transcriptional repression in ES cells and that H1 is a candidate to have a role in Xp imprinting.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 29 Total Times Cited: 29 Cited Reference Count: 60,10.1128/mcb.00734-10,x-chromosome inactivation;transcription in-vivo;stem-cells;methyltransferases dnmt3a;sexual-dimorphism;granulosa-cells;bovine embryos;oncofetal gene;family-members;linked gene;Multigene Family;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Histones,,

The interpretation of these studies, however, has been confounded by differences in the sex chromosome complement (XX versus XY). To investigate the sex chromosome complement independent of gonadal sex, we used the 4 core genotype mouse model in which gonadal sex is separated from the sex chromosome complement enabling comparisons among XX and XY females and XX and XY males. We found that, in the gonadectomized (GDX) 4 core genotype, MAP after 2 weeks of angiotensin II infusion (200 ng/kg per minute) was greater in XX than XY (MAP [in millimeters of mercury]: GDX-XX-female, 148 +/- 4.5; GDX-XY-female, 133 +/- 4.4; GDX-XX-male, 149 +/- 9.4; GDX-XY-male, 138 +/- 5.5; P<0,03, XX versus XY; n=8 to 9 per group). In contrast, no sex chromosome effects were found on heart rate, body weight, or plasma angiotensin II 2 weeks after angiotensin II infusion. This study suggests that, in addition to effects of gonadal hormones on blood pressure, X- or Y-linked genes, parental imprinting, or X mosaicism contributes to sex differences in hypertension. Furthermore, the finding that MAP was greater in XX mice compared with XY mice in the GDX state suggests that adverse sex chromosome effects encoded within the XX sex chromosome complement could contribute to hypertension in women with ovarian hormone deficiency, such as postmenopausal women and women with premature ovarian failure.

It often involves the extremities of adolescents and young adults and shows a predilection for females. Recently, ASPS was found to have a nonreciprocal der(17)t(X;17) translocation with the corresponding fusion gene located in chromosome 17. Because females have an extra X-chromosome, their likelihood of developing an X;autosome translocation is theoretically double that of males, and thus, this extra X-chromosome is a likely explanation for female predominance of ASPS. METHODS: The authors used data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry program, which included 87 ASPS cases (33 males and 54 females), and published ASPS cases, which included 317 cases (121 males and 196 females), to test our hypothesis. The authors compared the observed proportion of female cases with that expected under the two X-chromosomes-double-risk hypothesis including the consideration of X-inactivation status. RESULTS: The hypothesis that the fusion gene is not subject to X-inactivation is supported by data (P = 0.6, 0.24, and 0.20 for SEER cases, published cases, and their combination, respectively). In contrast, the competing hypothesis that the fusion gene is subject to X-inactivation is rejected (P = 0.007, < 0.00001, and < 0.00001 for SEER cases, published cases, and their combination, respectively).

Female eutherian mammals inactivate randomly the maternal or paternal inherited X-chromosome early in embryogenesis, whereas the extra-embryonic tissues experience an imprinting XCI that results in the inactivation of the paternal X-chromosome in mice. Although the phenomenon was initially described 40 years ago, many aspects remain obscure. In the last 2 years, some trademark publications have shed new light on the ongoing debate regarding the timing and mechanism of imprinted or random XCI. It has been observed that XCI is not accomplished at the blastocyst stage in bovines, rabbits, and humans, contrasting with the situation reported in mice, the standard model. All the species present 2 active X-chromosomes (Xa) in the early epiblast of the blastocyst, the cellular source for embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In this perspective, it would make sense to expect an absence of XCI in undifferentiated ESCs, but human ESCs are highly heterogeneous for this parameter and the presence of 2 Xa has been proposed as a true hallmark of ground-state pluripotency and a quality marker for female ESCs. Similarly, XCI reversal in female induced pluripotent stem cells is a key reprogramming event on the path to achieve the naïve pluripotency, and key pluripotency regulators can interact directly or indirectly with Xist. Finally, the presence of 2 Xa may lead to a sex-specific transcriptional regulation resulting in sexual dimorphism in reprogramming and differentiation. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",L364967530 2012-06-20,10.1089/scd.2011.0685,blastocyst;cell proliferation;ectoderm;embryo development;embryonic stem cell;environmental change;fluorescence in situ hybridization;gastrulation;human;immunohistochemistry;nonhuman;pluripotent stem cell;preimplantation embryo;priority journal;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;review;transcription regulation;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Stem Cells,,

Here we investigated the relationship between CpG densities around TSSs and the ratio of gene expression levels between sexes in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), which displays remarkable sexual dimorphisms. We found that genes with sex-biased gene expression had different CpG densities downstream of TSSs compared with genes lacking sex-biased gene expression. Intriguingly, male-biased expression genes with intermediate CpG density downstream of TSSs exhibited greater differences in gene expression between sexes in the gonad and tail.

Interestingly, unlike in other populations, there is a slight female predominance in the prevalence of parkinsonism in the Philippines. OBSERVATIONS: In a Filipino woman with suspected Parkinson disease, we confirmed the presence of all changes specific for X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism in genomic DNA. Subsequently, we analyzed complementary DNA and evaluated the methylation status of the androgen receptor gene. Owing to extremely skewed (98%:2%) X-chromosome inactivation, the patient expressed almost solely the mutated allele in a disease-specific change, rendering her molecularly comparable with a hemizygously affected man. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Skewed X-chromosome inactivation is the likely cause of parkinsonism in this heterozygous mutation carrier. Because women carriers of the genetic changes specific for X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism are common in the Philippines, the epigenetic factor of nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation may contribute to the skewing of the sex prevalence of parkinsonism toward women in this country, warranting further investigation.","2168-6157 Domingo, Aloysius Lee, Lillian V Brüggemann, Norbert Freimann, Karen Kaiser, Frank J Jamora, Roland D G Rosales, Raymond L Klein, Christine Westenberger, Ana Case Reports Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2014/07/09 JAMA Neurol. 2014 Sep;71(9):1177-80. doi: 10.1001/jamaneurol.2014.56.",10.1001/jamaneurol.2014.56,"Aged;Dystonic Disorders/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology;Female;Genetic Diseases, X-Linked/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology;Genetic Testing;Humans;Philippines;Sex Factors;X Chromosome Inactivation/genetics;Dystonia",,

Increased expression and activity of the long-noncoding RNA X-inactive–specific transcript (Xist), essential for X-chromosome inactivation and dosage compensation of X-linked genes, may explain the sex bias of PAH. The present studies used a murine model of plexiform PAH, the intersectin-1s (ITSN) heterozygous knockout (KOITSN+/–) mouse transduced with an ITSN fragment (EHITSN) possessing endothelial cell proliferative activity, in conjunction with molecular, cell biology, biochemical, morphologic, and functional approaches. The data demonstrate significant sex-centered differences with regard to EHITSN-induced alterations in pulmonary artery remodeling, lung hemodynamics, and p38/ETS domain containing protein/c-Fos signaling, altogether leading to a more severe female lung PAH phenotype. Moreover, the long-noncoding RNA–Xist is up-regulated in the lungs of female EHITSN-KOITSN+/– mice compared with that in female wild-type mice, leading to sex-specific modulation of the X-linked gene ETS domain containing protein and its target, two molecular events also characteristic to female human PAH lung. More importantly, cyclin A1 expression in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle of synchronized pulmonary artery endothelial cells of female PAH patients is greater versus controls, suggesting functional hyperproliferation. Thus, Xist up-regulation leading to female pulmonary artery endothelial cell sexual dimorphic behavior may provide a better understanding of the origin of sex bias in PAH.

However, there is limited research comparing sex-specific DNAm across tissues, particularly differentially methylated regions (DMRs).

Investigating these genes is of primary importance in understanding sexual dimorphism and genome evolution. In a particular instance in Drosophila, X-linked nuclear transport genes (Ntf-2 and ran) have given rise to autosomal retroposed copies three independent times (along the lineages leading to Drosophila melanogaster, D. ananassae, and D. grimshawi). Here we explore in further detail the expression and the mode of evolution of these Drosophila Ntf-2- and ran-derived retrogenes. Five of the six retrogenes show male-biased expression. The ran-like gene of D. melanogaster and D. simulans has undergone recurrent positive selection. Similarly, in D. ananassae and D. atripex, the Ntf-2 and ran retrogenes show evidence of past positive selection. The data suggest that strong selection is acting on the origin and evolution of these retrogenes. Avoiding male meiotic X inactivation, increasing level of expression of X-linked genes in male testes, and/or sexual antagonism might explain the recurrent duplication of retrogenes from X to autosomes. Interestingly, the ran-like in D. yakuba has mostly pseudogenized alleles. Disablement of the ran-like gene in D. yakuba indicates turnover of these duplicates. We discuss the possibility that Dntf-2r and ran-like might be involved in genomic conflicts during spermatogenesis.

Castration of male adult rats causes shrinkage of SNB somata, and testosterone replacement reverses this effect, but the site at which androgen is acting to cause this change is undetermined. We exploited the X-chromosome residency of the androgen receptor (AR) gene to generate androgenized female rats that were heterozygous for the testicular feminization mutant (tfm) AR mutation and that, as a consequence of ontogenetic random X-inactivation, expressed a blend of androgen-sensitive wild-type cells and tfm-affected androgen-insensitive cells in the SNB. Chronic testosterone treatment of adult mosaics increased soma sizes only in androgen-competent wild-type SNB cells. The size of tfm-affected SNB somata in the same animals did not differ from the size of either the wild-type or tfm-affected SNB neurons in control mosaics that did not receive androgen treatment in adulthood. Because the muscle targets of the SNB are known to be uniformly androgen-sensitive in tfm mosaics, this mosaic analysis provides unambiguous evidence that androgenic effects on motoneuron soma size are mediated locally in the SNB.

Most human autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS) and autoimmune thyroid disease, have an increased incidence and prevalence in females, but a few others such as autoimmune diabetes, the Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) and psoriasis are increased in males. Animal models of autoimmunity show an equivalent sexual dimorphism. The possible reasons for the differing incidence and prevalence of autoimmune diseases in females and males engage our attention. Environmental exposures may differ for females and males. There are innate differences in the function of the female and male immune systems, and there is some evidence for differences between females and males in the ability of a target organ for autoimmunity to withstand damage. In seeking reasons for these differences, we review the role of sex hormones in immunity and include results of trials of hormone therapy in autoimmune diseases. The association of autoimmunity and pregnancy, a female-specific condition, is discussed, and the claimed effects of lymphoid cell microchimerism on provocation of autoimmunity are reviewed. Genetic predisposition is an important factor in autoimmune disease and we particularly focus on genes on the X and Y chromosomes, the role of X chromosome inactivation, and the interaction of the sex of the patient with other genetic factors. The possible role of epigenetic mechanisms, including environmental influences, is then surveyed.

Diagnosis of heterozygously-deficient women is complicated: as a result of lyonization, these women have a normal and a G6PD-deficient population of erythrocytes. The cytochemical assay is the only reliable assay to discriminate between heterozygously-deficient women and non-deficient women or homozygously-deficient women. G6PD deficiency is mainly found in areas where malaria is or has been endemic. In these areas, malaria is treated with drugs that can cause (severe) hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. A cheap and reliable test is necessary for diagnosing the deficiency to prevent hemolytic disorders when treating malaria. In this review, it is concluded that the use of two different tests for diagnosing men and women is the ideal approach to detect G6PD deficiency. The fluorescent spot test is inexpensive and easy to perform but only reliable for discriminating hemizygous G6PD-deficient men from non-deficient men.

In addition to BM hypoplasia, some patients also developed myelodysplasia and acute myelod leukaemia. Pulmonary abnormalities were present in 19% of patients. In affected females the phenotype was less severe. Some female carriers of X-linked DC had clinical features. Carriers of X-linked DC showed skewed X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIPs), suggesting that cells expressing the normal DC allele have a growth/survival advantage over cells that express the mutant allele. Linkage analysis in multiplex families confirmed that the DKC1 gene, responsible for the X-linked form of DC, is located within Xq28 and facilitated its positional cloning. The high incidence of BM failure in association with a wide range of somatic abnormalities together with the ubiquitous expression of DKC1 suggest that, as well as having a critical role in normal haemopoiesis, this gene has a key role in normal cell biology.","Knight, S Vulliamy, T Copplestone, A Gluckman, E Mason, P Dokal, I Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 1999/01/14 Br J Haematol. 1998 Dec;103(4):990-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01103.x.",10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01103.x,"Adolescent;Adult;Cause of Death;Child;Child, Preschool;Dyskeratosis Congenita/*genetics;Female;Genetic Linkage;Hematologic Diseases/genetics;Heterozygote;Humans;Infant;Lung Diseases/genetics;Male;Pedigree;Phenotype;Registries;Sex Factors;X Chromosome/genetics",,

W.",,,,,"BACKGROUND: Several individual studies have suggested that autosomal CpG methylation differs by sex both in terms of individual CpG sites and global autosomal CpG methylation. However, these findings have been inconsistent and plagued by spurious associations due to the cross reactivity of CpG probes on commercial microarrays. We collectively analysed 76 published studies (n = 6,795) for sex-associated differences in both autosomal and sex chromosome CpG sites. RESULTS: Overall autosomal methylation profiles varied substantially by study, and we encountered substantial batch effects. We accounted for these by conducting random effects meta-analysis for individual autosomal CpG methylation associations. After excluding non-specific probes, we found 184 autosomal CpG sites differentially methylated by sex after correction for multiple testing. In line with previous studies, average beta differences were small. Many of the most significantly associated CpG probes were new. Of note was differential CpG methylation in the promoters of genes thought to be involved in spermatogenesis and male fertility, such as SLC9A2, SPESP1, CRISP2, and NUPL1. Pathway analysis revealed overrepresentation of genes differentially methylated by sex in several broad Gene Ontology biological processes, including RNA splicing and DNA repair. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents a comprehensive analysis of sex-specific methylation patterns. We demonstrate the existence of sex-specific methylation profiles and report a large number of novel DNA methylation differences in autosomal CpG sites between sexes.","1471-2164 McCarthy, Nina S Melton, Phillip E Cadby, Gemma Yazar, Seyhan Franchina, Maria Moses, Eric K Mackey, David A Hewitt, Alex W Journal Article Meta-Analysis Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2014/11/20 BMC Genomics. 2014 Nov 18;15(1):981. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-15-981.",10.1186/1471-2164-15-981,"*Chromosomes, Human;Chromosomes, Human, X;Computational Biology;CpG Islands;*DNA Methylation;Datasets as Topic;Female;Humans;Male;ROC Curve;Sex Factors;X Chromosome Inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Methylation",,

V.",,,,,"The choice mechanisms that determine the future inactive X chromosome in somatic cells of female mammals involve the regulated expression of the XIST gene. A familial C(-43)G mutation in the XIST promoter results in skewing of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) towards the inactive X chromosome of heterozygous females, whereas a C(-43)A mutation found primarily in the active X chromosome results in the opposite skewing pattern. Both mutations point to the existence of a factor that might be responsible for the skewed patterns. Here we identify this factor as CTCF, a conserved protein with a 11 Zn-finger (ZF) domain that can mediate multiple sequence-specificity and interactions between DNA-bound CTCF molecules. We show that mouse and human Xist/XIST promoters contain one homologous CTCF-binding sequence with the matching dG-contacts, which in the human XIST include the -43 position within the DNase I footprint of CTCF. While the C(-43)A mutation abrogates CTCF binding, the C(-43)G mutation results in a dramatic increase in CTCF-binding efficiency by altering ZF-usage mode required for recognition of the altered dG-contacts of the mutant site. Thus, the skewing effect of the two -43C mutations correlates with their effects on CTCF binding. Finally, CTCF interacts with the XIST/Xist promoter only in female human and mouse cells. The interpretation that this reflected a preferential interaction with the promoter of the active Xist allele was confirmed in mouse fetal placenta. These observations are in keeping with the possibility that the choice of X chromosome inactivation reflects stabilization of a higher order chromatin conformation impinging on the CTCF-XIST promoter complex.","Pugacheva, Elena M Tiwari, Vijay Kumar Abdullaev, Ziedulla Vostrov, Alexander A Flanagan, Patrick T Quitschke, Wolfgang W Loukinov, Dmitri I Ohlsson, Rolf Lobanenkov, Victor V",10.1093/hmg/ddi089,"Alleles;Animals;Base Sequence;CCCTC-Binding Factor;Cell Nucleus/metabolism;Chromatin/metabolism;Chromatin Immunoprecipitation;*Chromosomes, Human, X;DNA Methylation;DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism;Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Family Health;Female;Heterozygote;Humans;Immunoprecipitation;Male;Mice;Models, Genetic;Molecular Sequence Data;*Mutation;Plasmids/metabolism;*Point Mutation;*Promoter Regions, Genetic;Protein Binding;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein Conformation;Protein Structure, Tertiary;RNA, Long Noncoding;RNA, Untranslated/*genetics;Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism;Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid;Sex Factors;Transcription, Genetic;Zinc Fingers;X Chromosome;Point Mutation;Mutation",,

Different mechanisms have evolved to compensate for this difference in dosage of X-borne genes between sexes. In therian mammals, one of the X chromosomes is inactivated, whereas bird dosage compensation is partial and gene-specific. In therian mammals, hallmarks of the inactive X are monoallelic gene expression, late DNA replication and chromatin condensation. Platypuses have five pairs of X chromosomes in females and five X and five Y chromosomes in males. Gene expression analysis suggests a more bird-like partial and gene-specific dosage compensation mechanism. We investigated replication timing and chromosome condensation of three of the five X chromosomes in female platypus. Our data suggest asynchronous replication of X-specific regions on X-1, X-3 and X-5 but show significantly different condensation between homologues for X-3 only, and not for X-1 or X-5.

One of the most frequently reported data is sex-related severity and mortality: according to the last available analysis on 239,709 patients in Italy, lethality is 17.7% in men and 10.8% in women, with 59% of total deaths being men. Interestingly, the infection rate is lower in males than in females, with 45.8% and 54.2% of positive cases, respectively, suggesting that gender-related factor may worsen disease evolution. A tentative hypothesis to explain these findings is the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2 involved in viral infection. Purpose: In this review, we summarize the available evidence pointing to gender-related differences in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, from both genetic and endocrine points of view. Results: Altogether, available evidence points toward two not-mutually exclusive mechanisms in gender susceptibility to COVID-19 by sex hormonal regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. On one hand, ACE2 expression could be increased in women, either by estrogens or constitutively by X chromosome inactivation escape or by reduced methylation, providing a larger reservoir of ACE2 to maintain the fundamental equilibrium of RAS regulatory axis. On the other, low levels of androgens in women may keep at low levels TMPRSS2 expression, representing a further protective factor for the development of COVID-19 infection, despite the increased expression of ACE2, which represents the Trojan horse for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Conclusions: Both mechanisms consistently point to the role of sex hormones and sex chromosomes in the differential severity and lethality of COVID-19 in men and women.",L2006713000 2020-09-23 2021-09-29,10.1007/s40618-020-01383-6,angiotensin;angiotensin converting enzyme 2;angiotensin II;estrogen;renin;sex hormone;transmembrane protease serine 2;coronavirus disease 2019;gene;gene expression;hormonal regulation;human;infection sensitivity;inflammation;nonhuman;pathogenesis;protein expression;protein methylation;renin angiotensin aldosterone system;review;sex difference;virus entry;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome,,

There is a need to explore novel avenues to elucidate this sex bias in the development of chronic inflammatory pain conditions. Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic neuropathic pain disorder, and the incidence of CRPS is greater in women than in men by ~4:1. Since neurogenic inflammation is a key feature of CRPS, dysregulation of inflammatory responses can be a factor in predisposing women to chronic pain. Methods: Our studies investigating alterations in circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in whole blood from female CRPS patients showed significant differential expression of miRNAs between responders and poor responders to ketamine treatment. Several of these miRNAs are predicted to target the long noncoding RNA, X-inactive-specific transcript (XIST). XIST mediates X-chromosome inactivation and is essential for equalizing the expression of X-linked genes between females and males. Based on the well-established role in inflammatory process, we focused on miR-34a, one of the miRNAs predicted to target XIST, and downregulated in CRPS patients responding poorly to ketamine. Results: Our in vitro and in vivo models of acute inflammation and data from patients with CRPS showed that miR-34a can regulate XIST under inflammation directly, and through proinflammatory transcription factor Yin-Yang 1 (YY1). XIST was significantly upregulated in a subset of CRPS patients responding poorly to ketamine. Conclusion: Since dysregulation of XIST can result in genes escaping inactivation or reactivation in female cells, further investigations on the role of XIST in the predominance of chronic inflammatory and pain disorders in women is warranted.",L622304472 2018-06-06 2018-06-14,10.2147/jpr.S159458,ketamine;long untranslated RNA;microRNA 34a;transcription factor YY1;unclassified drug;X inactive specific transcript;adult;aged;animal cell;article;complex regional pain syndrome;controlled study;down regulation;female;gene expression;human;human cell;in vitro study;in vivo study;inflammation;male;middle aged;mouse;nonhuman;pathogenesis;sex difference;upregulation;X chromosome inactivation;young adult,,

G.",,,,,"Disruptive selection between males and females can generate sexual antagonism, where alleles improving fitness in one sex reduce fitness in the other. This type of genetic conflict arises because males and females carry nearly identical sets of genes: opposing selection, followed by genetic mixing during reproduction, generates a population genetic ""tug-of-war'' that constrains adaptation in either sex. Recent verbal models suggest that gene duplication and sex-specific cooption of paralogs might resolve sexual antagonism and facilitate evolutionary divergence between the sexes. However, this intuitive proximal solution for sexual dimorphism potentially belies a complex interaction between mutation, genetic drift, and positive selection during duplicate fixation and sex-specific paralog differentiation. The interaction of these processes-within the explicit context of duplication and sexual antagonism-has yet to be formally described by population genetics theory. Here, we develop and analyze models of gene duplication and sex-specific differentiation between paralogs. We show that sexual antagonism can favor the fixation and maintenance of gene duplicates, eventually leading to the evolution of sexually dimorphic genetic architectures for male and female traits. The timescale for these evolutionary transitions is sensitive to a suite of genetic and demographic variables, including allelic dominance, recombination, sex linkage, and population size. Interestingly, we find that female-beneficial duplicates preferentially accumulate on the X chromosome, whereas male-beneficial duplicates are biased toward autosomes, independent of the dominance parameters of sexually antagonistic alleles. Although this result differs from previous models of sexual antagonism, it is consistent with several findings from the empirical genomics literature.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 77 Total Times Cited: 77 Cited Reference Count: 115,10.1534/genetics.110.123729,x-chromosome inactivation;copy-number polymorphism;biased genes;chicken z;drosophila-mauritiana;stable equilibria;2 rules;evolution;selection;conflict,,

It is not clear whether prevention of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is mediated by gene networks that preserve the naive state. Here, we show that robust naive pluripotent stem cell (nPSC) self-renewal represses expression of Xist, the master regulator of XCI. We found that nPSCs accumulate Xist on the male X chromosome and on both female X chromosomes as they become NANOG negative at the onset of differentiation. This is accompanied by the appearance of a repressive chromatin signature and partial X-linked gene silencing, suggesting a transient and rapid XCI-like state in male nPSCs. In the embryo, Xist is transiently expressed in males and in females from both X chromosomes at the onset of naive epiblast differentiation. In conclusion, we propose that XCI initiation is gender independent and triggered by destabilization of naive identity, suggesting that gender-specific mechanisms follow, rather than precede, XCI initiation. Silva and colleagues report that the initiation of X chromosome inactivation takes place in males and on both X chromosomes in females. This is transient and rapid and is triggered by downregulation of naive pluripotent transcription factors during the onset of differentiation.",L2000775687 2018-05-28 2018-06-05,10.1016/j.stem.2018.05.001,article;cell differentiation;controlled study;embryo;female;fluorescence in situ hybridization;gender identity;gene expression;gene silencing;human;male;pluripotent stem cell;priority journal;sex difference;stem cell self-renewal;upregulation;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome,,

W. and Caskey, C. T. and Martin, G. R.",,,,,"It has been proposed that DNA methylation is involved in the mechanism of X inactivation, the process by which equivalence of levels of X-linked gene products is achieved in female (XX) and male (XY) mammals. In this study, Southern blots of female and male DNA digested with methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases and hybridized to various portions of the cloned mouse hprt gene were compared, and sites within the mouse hprt gene were identified that are differentially methylated in female and male cells. The extent to which these sites are methylated when carried on the active and inactive X chromosomes was directly determined in a similar analysis of DNA from clonal cell lines established from a female embryo derived from a mating of two species of mouse, Mus musculus and Mus caroli. The results revealed two regions of differential methylation in the mouse hprt gene. One region, in the first intron of the gene, includes four sites that are completely unmethylated when carried on the active X and extensively methylated when carried on the inactive X. These same sites are extensively demethylated in hprt genes reactivated either spontaneously or after 5-azacytidine treatment. The second region includes several sites in the 3' 20kilobases of the gene extending from exon 3 to exon 9 that show the converse pattern; i.e., they are completely methylated when carried on the active X and completely unmethylated when carried on the inactive X. At least one of these sites does not become methylated after reactivation of the gene. The results of this study, together with the results of previous studies by others of the human hprt gene, indicate that these regions of differential methylation on the active and inactive X are conserved between mammalian species. Furthermore, the data described here are consistent with the idea that at least the sites in the 5' region of the gene play a role in the X inactivation phenomenon and regulation of expression of the mouse hprt gene.","1098-5549 Lock, L F Melton, D W Caskey, C T Martin, G R R01 CA25966/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

Although the etiology and pathogenesis remain poorly understood in most cases, similarities between diseases outnumber differences in the initiation and perpetuation of the autoimmune injury. One major example is the predominance of affected women, and perhaps its most intriguing putative mechanism is related to sex chromosomes, based on the recent observation that women with autoimmune diseases manifest a higher rate of circulating leukocytes with a single X chromosome. In a complementary fashion, there have been several reports on a role of X chromosome gene dosage through inactivation or duplication in autoimmunity. It is important not to overlook men with autoimmune diseases, who might manifest a more frequent loss of the Y chromosome in circulating leukocytes.

We describe two unrelated patients with developmental delay due to similar interstitial duplications at Xp21-p22. The first patient is a 6-month-old male with multiple affected family members including many females. The second patient is a 5-year-old adopted female. In both patients, chromosome analysis and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed duplications of overlapping regions at Xp21-p22. The duplicated segments contain numerous genes associated with MR, including AP1S2, NHS, CDKL5, RPS6KA3, SMS, and ARX. Except for developmental delay, there is little phenotypic overlap between the male and the female patient. Additionally, the female patient and affected female relatives of the male patient have variable severities of cognitive impairment, likely due to different X-inactivation patterns and effects of other, nonduplicated genes important for normal development. These cases illustrate that increased gene dosage of X-linked MR genes lead to cognitive impairment. Precise delineation of chromosome rearrangements by a CGH and identification of genes within duplicated segments helped in establishing genotype - phenotype correlations for each of our patients, in comparing them to each other, as well as with previously reported cases of Xp21-p22 duplications.

It has an estimated incidence of 1:10000-15000 females. Mutations in the X-linked gene methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) have been found in most patients. The most accepted explanation for the sex bias is that the Rett mutation in sporadic cases has its origin in the paternal germline X chromosome and can thus only be transmitted to females. The majority of cases are sporadic (99.5%) but some familial cases have been described. These cases can either be explained by germline mosaicism or by asymptomatic carrier mothers with skewing of X-inactivation towards the wild-type MECP2 allele. We describe one of the few familial cases of RTT in which a maternal germline mosaicism is the most likely explanation. The mutation p.Arg270fs (c.808delC) was identified in both a girl with classical RTT and her brother who had the severe neurological phenotype usually described in males. The mutation was absent in DNA extracted from blood of both parents. These type of events must be taken into consideration in the genetic counselling of families after the diagnosis of a first case of RTT in a female or a MECP2 mutation in a male.,L47109052 2007-08-01,10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201835,DNA;methyl CpG binding protein 2;article;ataxia;body dysmorphic disorder;case report;death;developmental disorder;disease severity;DNA extraction;female;gastrointestinal infection;gene mutation;genetic counseling;germ line;growth retardation;happy puppet syndrome;human;male;metabolic disorder;mosaicism;neurologic disease;parent;phenotype;preschool child;priority journal;Rett syndrome;stereotypy;Rett Syndrome,,

Our analysis was tailored for maximum sensitivity to discover Y-chromosome gene expression, but at the same time, it was underpowered to detect X-inactivation escapees. Using this approach, we found that 5 out of 13 expressed gametolog pairs showed unbalanced gene dosage, and as a consequence, a male-biased expression.

The breakpoints on the X chromosome in these five translocations are in Xp22. Several independent clones from each fusion were isolated in HAT medium. The clones were examined cytogenetically, and in each case at least two independent clones were identified that have an active X/Y or X/10 translocation chromosome in the absence of other X or Y material. These clones were then tested for STS and 12E7 expression. In two of the X/Y translocations, the markers, STS and 12E7, were both absent. In the X/10 and a third X/Y translocation, both markers were retained. In each of three clones containing the fourth X/Y translocation, STS activity was retained but 12E7 antigenicity was lost.

We performed a systematic profiling of gene expression comparing male and female embryos using available single-cell RNA-sequencing data of 1607 individual cells from 99 human preimplantation embryos, covering development stages from 4-cell to late blastocyst. We observed consistent chromosome-wide transcription of autosomes, whereas expression from sex chromosomes exhibits significant differences after embryonic genome activation (EGA). Activation of the Y chromosome is initiated by expression of two genes, RPS4Y1 and DDX3Y, whereas the X chromosome is widely activated, with both copies in females being activated after EGA. In contrast to the stable activation of the Y chromosome, expression of X-linked genes in females declines at the late blastocyst stage, especially in trophectoderm cells, revealing a rapid process of dosage compensation. This dynamic behavior results in a dosage imbalance between male and female embryos, which influences genes involved in cell cycle, protein translation and metabolism. Our results reveal the dynamics of sex chromosomes expression and silencing during early embryogenesis.

Within the last 40 years, more and more details of monotreme physiology, histology, reproduction and genetics have been revealed. Some show similarities with birds or reptiles, some with therian mammals, but many are very specific to monotremes. The genome is no exception to monotreme uniqueness. An early opinion was that the karyotype, composed of a few large chromosomes and many small ones, resembled bird and reptile macro- and micro-chromosomes.

As with many autoimmune diseases, MG has a multifactorial etiology, resulting from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, as fully described in this review. Among environmental factors, viral infections could play a central role in autoimmunity, mainly through the induction of dysregulated Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated innate immune responses, which can lead to inflammation and adaptive autoimmune response. Growing evidence of chronic inflammation, TLR activation, and persistent viral infections in the thymus of MG patients, strongly supports the hypothesis that, in the context of a genetic susceptible background, the intrathymic innate immune responses to pathogen infections might contribute to MG etiology. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..",L52534159 2013-04-22 2013-07-01,10.1016/j.autrev.2013.03.010,gamma interferon;HLA antigen class 1;interferon;interferon consensus sequence binding protein;interferon regulatory factor 5;interferon regulatory factor 7;interleukin 10;interleukin 12;interleukin 2;interleukin 28A;interleukin 28B;interleukin 29;interleukin 5;non receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase 22;protein kinase R;retinoic acid receptor;stromal cell derived factor 1;toll like receptor 1;toll like receptor 10;toll like receptor 2;toll like receptor 3;toll like receptor 4;toll like receptor 5;toll like receptor 6;toll like receptor 7;toll like receptor 8;toll like receptor 9;tumor necrosis factor;3' untranslated region;adaptive immunity;antigen binding;antigen presenting cell;autoimmunity;B lymphocyte activation;cell proliferation;complement activation;cross reaction;disease course;disease predisposition;environmental factor;genetic association;genetic susceptibility;genetic variability;genotyping;haplotype;heredity;HLA system;homozygosity;human;humoral immunity;immunological tolerance;innate immunity;myasthenia gravis;nonhuman;pathogenicity;phenotype;promoter region;protein interaction;regulatory T lymphocyte;review;rheumatoid arthritis;risk factor;sex difference;somatic hypermutation;systemic lupus erythematosus;thymoma;thymus;thymus hyperplasia;upregulation;virus infection;X chromosome inactivation;Myasthenia Gravis,,

Up to two thirds of human anencephalics and mouse exencephalics from various genetic causes are female, but the cause of this female excess is unknown. It appears not to be attributable to gonadal hormones, developmental delay in females, or preferential death of affected males. Recent studies of the Trp53 mouse mutant showed that exencephaly susceptibility depends on the presence of two X chromosomes, not the absence of the Y. Over a decade ago, we hypothesized that the relevant difference between female and male mammalian embryos at the time of cranial neural tube closure is the fact that females methylate most of the DNA in the large inactive X chromosome after every cell division, reducing the methylation available for other needs in female cells. Recently, the Whitelaw laboratory identified several proteins in mice (Momme D genes) involved in epigenetic silencing and methylation and shared in the silencing of transgenes, retrotransposons, and the inactive-X, and suggested that the inactive-X acts as a ""sink"" for epigenetic silencing proteins. The ""inactive-X sink"" hypothesis can be used to suggest expected changes in sex ratio in cranial NTDs in response to various genetic or environmental alterations. We recommend that observation of sex ratio become a standard component of all NTD studies. We suggest that the female excess among cranial NTDs is an epigenetic phenomenon whose molecular investigation will produce insight into the mechanisms underlying NTDs.","1542-0760 Juriloff, Diana M Harris, Muriel J Journal Article United States 2012/07/04 Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol. 2012 Oct;94(10):849-55. doi: 10.1002/bdra.23036.

The locus for steroid sulphatase (STS; EC 3.1.6.2), the microsomal enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of various 3β-hydroxysteroid sulphates, is exceptional because it seems to escape inactivation. Evidence for this comes from fibroblast clones in females heterozygous for mutations that result in a severe deficiency of this enzyme in affected males; all clones from these heterozygotes have STS activity, and enzyme-deficient clones that are expected if the locus were subject to inactivation, have not been found. Further evidence that the STS locus escapes inactivation is that the human inactive X chromosome contributes STS activity to mouse-human hybrid cells. On the basis of these hybrid studies the STS locus has been mapped to the distal half of the short arm (p22-pter) of the human X chromosome. Although the STS locus on both X chromosomes in human female cells is expressed, quantitative measurements of STS activity in males and females do not accurately reflect the sex differences in number of X chromosomes (Table 1). The ratio of mean values for normal females to that of normal males is greater than 1:1 but less than the ratio of 2:1 expected if STS loci on all X chromosomes were equally expressed. The incomplete dosage effect suggests that the STS locus on the inactive X chromosome might not be fully expressed. To test this hypothesis, we examined two heterozygotes for X-linked STS deficiency who were also heterozygous for the common electrophoretic variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD A and B). Studies of fibroblast clones from these females provide evidence, presented here, for differential expression of STS loci on the active and inactive X chromosome.",L12003306 1982-12-17,10.1038/299838a0,"steryl sulfatase;case report;congenital disorder;diagnosis;fibroblast culture;gene activity;gene expression;gene location;gene locus;heredity;human cell;in vitro study;normal human;normal value;pedigree;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Chromosomes, Human, X;X Chromosome",,

We compared variant types and phenotypes in males and females and performed an analysis of IQSEC2 isoforms. Results: IQSEC2 pathogenic variants mainly led to premature truncation and were scattered throughout the longest brain-specific isoform, encoding the synaptic IQSEC2/BRAG1 protein. Variants occurred de novo in females but were either de novo (2/3) or inherited (1/3) in males, with missense variants being predominantly inherited. Developmental delay and intellectual disability were overall more severe in males than in females. Likewise, seizures were more frequently observed and intractable, and started earlier in males than in females. No correlation was observed between the age at seizure onset and severity of intellectual disability or resistance to antiepileptic treatments.

The Y chromosome promotes the growth of permanent tooth crown enamel and dentin, whereas the effect of the X chromosome seems to be restricted mainly on enamel formation. Also, there are evidences that both of the sex chromosomes are expressed in tooth root growth. The permanent tooth crowns in 47,XXY males or individuals with an extra X or Y chromosome show increased size compared to normal men, which is mainly due to increased enamel thickness, the dentin thickness is somewhat reduced. There is some evidence of increased mesio-distal tooth crown size also in their primary dentition. The aim of the present study was to determine their complete permanent tooth root lengths. The study groups consisted of 49 47,XXY males, 22 relative males, 8 relative females, 35 population control males and 46 population control females from the Kvantti research project. Root length measurements were made from panoramic radiographs on both sides of the jaw using a digital sliding calliper. The results showed growth increase in the final tooth root sizes in 47,XXY males which conceivably become evident beginning 8 years after birth up to the age of 14 years, at least. The present results and earlier ones on 45,X and 45,X/46,XX females, normal females and males indicate that the promoting effect of the Y chromosome on tooth root growth is greater than that of the X chromosome. These differential effects are conceivably causative factors in the development of the sexual dimorphism in tooth root size. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There is strong evidence that human males and females differ in terms of growth and development in utero and that these divergent growth strategies appear to place males at increased risk when in sub-optimal conditions. Since the placenta is the interface of maternal-fetal exchange throughout pregnancy, these developmental differences are most likely orchestrated by differential placental function. To date, progress in this field has been hampered by a lack of genome-wide information on sex differences in placental gene expression. Therefore, our motivation in this study was to characterize sex-biased gene expression in the human placenta. We obtained gene expression data for > 300 non-pathological placenta samples from 11 microarray datasets and applied mapping-based array probe re-annotation and inverse-variance meta-analysis methods which showed that > 140 genes (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) are differentially expressed between male and female placentae. A majority of these genes (> 60%) are autosomal, many of which are involved in high-level regulatory processes such as gene transcription, cell growth and proliferation and hormonal function. Of particular interest, we detected higher female expression from all seven genes in the LHB-CGB cluster, which includes genes involved in placental development, the maintenance of pregnancy and maternal immune tolerance of the conceptus. These results demonstrate that sex-biased gene expression in the normal human placenta occurs across the genome and includes genes that are central to growth, development and the maintenance of pregnancy.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 106 Total Times Cited: 107 Cited Reference Count: 66,10.1093/molehr/gau035,gene expression;microarray;placenta;pregnancy;sex chromosomes;INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;PACKAGE;HCG;PREECLAMPSIA;GENERATION;PLACENTAS;PATTERNS;PROFILE;GENDER;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Transcriptome;Gene Expression,,

Males with only one X chromosome tend to express the genes on the X chromosome more fully than females, who express an ""average"" of their two X chromosomes due to X-inactivation. Greater variability in expression of genes on the X chromosome could account for greater variability in male cognitive ability. This would affect both the high and lowends of the cognitive ability distribution, but the possibility of high-end impact has drawn the most attention and controversy. The objective of this paper was to outline a method to test for empirical evidence that greater X-chromosomal variation in males is associated with greater variation in cognitive ability in males at the high end of the distribution. The method utilizes exogenous variation in the maternal X chromosome of twins to test the effect of sex on within-pair variation.We applied this method to g composite test scores at age 10 using data from the Twins Early Development Study. Twin-pair zygosity was used as an instrument reflecting whether twins had different maternal X chromosomes. We estimated differences in the association between variation in the maternalXchromosome inmales and females and within-pair variation in test scores using a difference in differences specification of a linear regression model. We found no evidence supporting the proposition that the ""averaging"" effect of X-inactivation in females resulted in greater variation in male cognitive ability.

In this study, a thorough transcriptional analysis of five XCI-related genes was performed by single cell reverse-transcribed PCR. An analysis of the XCI-related gene (Xist, Tsix, SUV39H1, SET7, and DNMT1) expression was performed to investigate the initiation process of XCI from early mouse single embryo (1-cell, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and blastocyst). Detection of the expression of Xist and Tsix from single 2-cell embryo was feasible, although the expression of those genes was very low in single 1-cell embryo. Transcription of those genes may be activated from single 2-cell embryo. After determining the sex of single embryo by Y-chromosome-specific Zfy expression, we found that Tsix could be detected from both male and female single embryos, but it was only possible to detect Xist from female single embryo. XCI chromatin-remodeling genes, such as histone H3 methylation enzymes (SUV39H1 and SET7) and DNA methylation enzyme (DNMT1), were expressed during all early phases of embryogenesis. The expression of those genes in single embryo was not dependent on sex. Our study illustrated that the expression of these chromatin-remodeling genes, SUV39H1, DNMT1, and SET7, may be originated from germ cells, which were not dependent on zygotic activation of Xist from female single embryo. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We observe 322 transcripts DE between male and female CV from 11 to 16 weeks, with 22 transcripts logFC > 1. Contrary to our predictions, the difference between male and female expression of DE autosomal genes was more pronounced at the earlier gestational ages. In females, we found selective upregulation of extracellular matrix components, along with a number of X-linked genes. In males, DE transcripts centered on chromosome 19, with mitochondrial, immune, and pregnancy maintenance-related transcripts upregulated. Among the highest differentially expressed autosomal genes were CCRL2, LGALS13, and LGALS14, which are known to regulate immune cell interactions. Our results provide insight into sex-linked gene expression in late first and early second trimester developing human placenta and lay the groundwork to understand the mechanistic origins of sex differences in prenatal development.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 9 Total Times Cited: 9 Cited Reference Count: 109,10.1007/s43032-020-00355-8,Placenta;Chorionic villus;Fetal-maternal interface;Sex differences;Trancriptome;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;GENE-EXPRESSION;H-Y;HISTOCOMPATIBILITY ANTIGEN;MATERNAL ASTHMA;RISK-FACTORS;HUMAN TROPHOBLAST;GESTATIONAL-AGE;C19MC MICRORNAS;PRETERM BIRTH;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Transcriptome;Sex Characteristics,,

XCI timing has been suggested to differ greatly among species, and in bovine, most of the X-linked transcripts are upregulated in female blastocysts. To determine the timing of XCI, we analyzed in day 14 bovine embryos the sexual dimorphic transcription of seven X-linked genes known to be upregulated in female blastocysts (X24112, brain-expressed X-linked 2 (BEX2), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2A (UBE2A), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), brain-expressed X-linked 1 (BEX1), calpain 6 (CAPN6), and spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1)). The transcription of five genes whose expression differs between sexes at the blastocyst stage (DNMT3A, interferon tau (IFNT2), glutathione S-transferase mu 3 (GSTM3), progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), and laminin alpha 1 (LAMA1)) and four genes related with sex determination (Wilms tumor 1 (WT1), gata binding protein 4 (GATA4), zinc finger protein multitype 2 (ZFPM2), and DMRT1) was also analyzed to determine the evolution of transcriptional sexual dimorphism. The expression level of five X-linked transcripts was effectively equalized among sexes suggesting that, in cattle, a substantial XCI occurs during the period between blastocyst hatching and initiation of elongation, although UBE2A and SAT1 displayed significant transcriptional differences. Similarly, sexual dimorphism was also reduced for autosomal genes with only DNMT3A and IFNT2 exhibiting sex-related differences. Among the genes potentially involved in sex determination, Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) was significantly upregulated in males and GATA4 in females, whereas no differences were observed for ZFPM2 and DMRT1. In conclusion, a major XCI occurred between the blastocyst and early elongation stages leading to a reduction in the transcriptional sexual dimorphism of autosomal genes, which makes the period the most susceptible to sex-specific embryo loss. © 2011 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.",L361834334 2011-06-06,10.1530/rep-11-0006,brain expressed x linked 1;brain expressed x linked 2;calpain;calpain 6;gata binding protein 4;glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase;glutathione transferase M3;laminin 1;progesterone receptor membrane component 1;protein;spermine n acetyltransferase 1;tau interferon;unclassified drug;zinc finger protein;animal cell;article;embryo;female;gene expression;genetic transcription;male;mouse;nonhuman;priority journal;sex determination process;sex difference;tumor suppressor gene;X chromosome inactivation;X chromosome linkage,,

As is the norm for aetiological studies into the majority of psychiatric phenotypes, particular focus has fallen on the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. There are, however, several epidemiological, clinical and molecular peculiarities associated with MDD that are hard to explain using traditional gene and environment-based approaches. Our goal in this study is to demonstrate the benefits of looking beyond conventional DNA+environment' and 'DNA x environment' aetiological paradigms. Epigenetic factors - inherited and acquired modifications of DNA and histones that regulate various genomic functions occurring without a change in nuclear DNA sequence - offer new insights about many of the non-Mendelian features of major depression, and provide a direct mechanistic route via which the environment can interact with the genome. The study of epigenetics, especially in complex diseases, is a relatively new field of research, and optimal laboratory techniques and analysis methods are still being developed. Incorporating epigenetic research into aetiological studies of MDD thus presents a number of methodological and interpretive challenges that need to be addressed.

We performed simulations to demonstrate the impact of X chromosome model assumptions on effect estimates. We investigated the coefficient biases of SNP and sex effects with commonly used models for X chromosome SNPs, including models with and without assumptions of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), and with and without SNP-sex interaction terms. Additional scenarios were assessed assuming non-random XCI (the presence of XCI skewness towards one parental chromosome), equivalent to dominance deviation from the additive genetic model. Sex and SNP coefficient biases were observed when assumptions made about XCI and sex differences in SNP effect in the analysis model were inconsistent with the data-generating model. However, including a SNP-sex interaction term often eliminated these biases. To illustrate these findings, estimates under different genetic model assumptions are compared and interpreted in a real data example. Models to analyze X chromosome SNPs make assumptions beyond those made in autosomal variant analysis.

The clinical variability, determinants of severity, and genotype/phenotype correlations of these diseases are not well characterized. OBJECTIVE To describe the baseline clinical characteristics, genotypes, and determinants of disease severity in a large patient cohort with EPP or XLP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective observational studywas conducted among patients with confirmed diagnoses of EPP or XLP from November 1, 2010, to December 6, 2015, at 6 academic medical centers of the Porphyrias Consortium of the National Institutes of Health Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network. Detailed medical histories, including history of phototoxicity and treatment, were collected on standardized case report forms. Patients underwent baseline laboratory testing, total erythrocyte protoporphyrin (ePPIX) testing, and molecular genetic testing. Data were entered into a centralized database. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Results of biochemical and genetic testswere explored for association with clinical phenotype in patients with EPP or XLP. RESULTS Of the 226 patients in the study (113 female and 113 male patients; mean [SD] age, 36.7 [17.0] years), 186 (82.3%) had EPP with a FECH (OMIM 612386) mutation and the common low-expression FECH allele IVS3-48T>C, and only 1 patient had 2 FECH mutations. Twenty-two patients had XLP (9.7%; 10 male and 12 female patients), and 9 patients (4.0%) had elevated ePPIX levels and symptoms consistent with protoporphyria but no detectable mutation in the FECH or ALAS2 (OMIM 301300) gene. Samples of DNA could not be obtained from 8 patients. Patients' mean (SD) age at symptom onset was 4.4 (4.4) years. Anemia (107 [47.3%]), history of liver dysfunction (62 [27.4%]), and gallstones (53 [23.5%]) were commonly reported. Higher ePPIX levels were associated with earlier age of symptom onset (median ePPIX levels for those who developed symptoms before vs after 1 year of age, 1744 vs 1567 μg/dL; P = .02), less sun tolerance (median ePPIX levels for those reporting symptoms before vs after 10 minutes of sun exposure, 2233 vs 1524 μg/dL; P < .001), and increased risk of liver dysfunction (median ePPIX levels for those with liver dysfunction vs normal liver function, 2016 vs 1510 μg/dL; P = .003). Patients with EPP and FECH missense mutations had significantly lower ePPIX levels than those with other mutations (1462 vs 1702 μg/dL; P = .01). Male patients with XLP had significantly higher ePPIX levels, on average, than did patients with EPP (3574 vs 1669 μg/dL; P < .001). Marked clinical variability was seen in female patients with XLP owing to random X-chromosomal inactivation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These data suggest that higher ePPIX levels are a major determinant of disease severity and risk of liver dysfunction in patients with EPP or XLP.

Female carriers of X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) demonstrate variability in clinical phenotype that, unlike males, cannot be correlated with genotype. X-inactivation, the method by which females (XX) silence transcription from one X chromosome in order to achieve gene dosage parity with males (XY), likely modifies the carrier phenotype, but this hypothesis has not been tested directly.Methods. Using a genetically defined mouse model of XLAS, we generated two groups of Alport female (Col4a5+/-) carriers that differed only in the X-controlling element (Xce) allele regulating X-inactivation. We followed the groups as far as 6 months of age comparing survival and surrogate outcome measures of urine protein and plasma urea nitrogen.Results. Preferential inactivation of the mutant Col4a5 gene improved survival and surrogate outcome measures of urine protein and plasma urea nitrogen. In studies of surviving mice, we found that X-inactivation in kidney, measured by allele-specific mRNA expression assays, correlated with surrogate outcomes.Conclusions.

This information would indicate whether or not MAO-A gene dosage could potentially explain the observed gender differences that show functional connections to the serotonin system, such as aggression, and impulsiveness. To investigate the X inactivation status of MAO-A we have used primary clonal cell cultures, on which allelic expression was assessed with RFLP analysis.

In female mammals, mono-allelic expression of the long non-coding RNA gene X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) is essential for initiation of X chromosome inactivation upon differentiation. We have previously demonstrated that the central factor of super elongation complex-like 3 (SEC-L3), AFF3, is enriched at gamete differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the imprinted loci and regulates the imprinted gene expression. Here, we found that AFF3 can also bind to the DMR downstream of the XIST promoter. Knockdown of AFF3 leads to de-repression of the inactive allele of XIST in terminally differentiated cells. In addition, the binding of AFF3 to the XIST DMR relies on DNA methylation and also regulates DNA methylation level at DMR region. However, the KAP1-H3K9 methylation machineries, which regulate the imprinted loci, might not play major roles in maintaining the mono-allelic expression pattern of XIST in these cells.

We have investigated the possible role of X-linked genes in the aetiology of social behaviour problems, including those involved in autistic spectrum disorders. A novel approach has been implemented. This is based on predictions following from stochastic patterns of X-inactivation of lower concordance of monozygous female (MZF) twins than MZM twins for behaviours underpinned by X-linked QTLs and the converse that DZF twins are expected to correlate more strongly for X-linked traits than DZM twins because unlike males, females always have at least one X chromosome in common. These expectations were tested in an ongoing longitudinal cohort study in which all twins born in England and Wales between 1994 and 1996 were invited to take part. 1000 each of MZF, MZM, DZF and DZM pairs from TEDS were tested at 7 and 8 years of age. The results suggest the persistent influence of X-linked genes on cognition and social behaviour problems, including those involved in autistic spectrum disorders, from early to middle childhood. This emphasises the potential importance of X-linked genes in the developmental trajectories of behaviour and mental health and the need to stratify genetic analysis of behaviours by gender.","1469-1809 Loat, C S Haworth, C M A Plomin, R Craig, I W G0500079/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom G0500079(73692)/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom G19/2/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Twin Study England 2008/07/31 Ann Hum Genet. 2008 Nov;72(Pt 6):742-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-1809.2008.00470.x.

RESULTS: Motor nerve conduction parameters in CMT1X women were less abnormal (P < 0.05), and a wider range of motor conduction velocities (CVs) were seen in women (P < 0.001) compared with men. In women, nerve conduction studies showed lack of conduction block without temporal dispersion. Motor CVs were more frequently in the normal range in women compared with men. There was no significant relationship to age of presentation and motor CV or compound muscle action potential in women.

From a genomic library of DNA of the hamster-human cell hybrid X3000.1 digested with the rare cutter restriction enzyme EagI, 53 different human clones have been isolated and characterized by methylation and sequence analysis. The characteristic pattern of DNA methylation of CpG islands at the 5' end of genes of the X chromosome has been used to distinguish between EagI sites in CpG islands versus isolated EagI sites. The sequence analysis has confirmed and completed the characterization showing that sequences at the 5' end of known genes were among the clones defined CpG islands and that the non-CpG islands clones were mostly repetitive sequences with a non-methylated or variably methylated EagI site. Thus, since clones corresponding to repetitive sequences can be easily identified by sequencing, such libraries are a very good source of CpG islands. The methylation analysis of 28 different new probes allows to state that demethylation of CpG islands of the active X and methylation of those on the inactive X chromosome are the general rule.

Anosmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs. Hypogonadism is due to GnRH deficiency and is likely to result from the failed embryonic migration of GnRH-synthesizing neurons. These cells normally migrate from the olfactory epithelium to the forebrain along the olfactory nerve pathway. KAL is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. The gene responsible for the X-chromosome linked form of the disease (KAL1) has been identified in 1991. KAL1 encodes anosmin-1, an approx. 95-kDa glycoprotein of unknown function which is present locally in various extracellular matrices during the period of organogenesis. The recent finding that FGFR1 mutations are involved in an autosomal dominant form of Kallmann syndrome (KAL2), combined with the analysis of mutant mouse embryos that no longer express Fgfr1 in the telencephalon, suggests that the disease results from a deficiency in FGF signaling at the earliest stage of olfactory bulb morphogenesis. We propose that the role of anosmin-1 is to enhance FGF signaling and suggest that the gender difference in anosmin-1 dose (because KAL1 partially escapes X-inactivation) explains the higher prevalence of the disease in males. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",L40022266 2005-01-10,10.1007/s00109-004-0571-y,anosmin 1;fibroblast growth factor;fibroblast growth factor receptor 1;glycoprotein;gonadorelin;unclassified drug;anosmia;autosomal dominant inheritance;cell migration;extracellular matrix;forebrain;gene identification;gene mutation;genetic heterogeneity;hormone deficiency;hormone synthesis;human;hypogonadotropic hypogonadism;hypoplasia;Kallmann syndrome;morphogenesis;mouse mutant;nerve cell;nonhuman;olfactory bulb;olfactory epithelium;olfactory nerve;organogenesis;prevalence;protein expression;protein function;review;sex difference;signal transduction;telencephalon;X chromosome linked disorder;Fibroblasts;Fibroblast Growth Factors,,

In the broad field of neuromuscular disorders we can encounter gender-specific diseases, mainly related to the X-chromosome abnormalities, and gender-influenced disorders, which are more common in one sex or have a different course in each sex. Moreover, we have to deal with other gender-specific issues, such as fertility, pregnancy and delivery complications in women with muscle disorders. Well-known examples of the first group are the X-linked muscular dystrophies and myopathies, such as dystrophinopathies, emerinopathies, and centronuclear myopathy. In the recessive disorders, males usually present a defined, more severe phenotype, whereas females carrying one mutated allele may show very different clinical pictures, mainly related to the variable X chromosome inactivation, thus complicating the diagnostic procedures. When evaluating a female with muscle symptoms, the possibility of a carrier status for an X-linked disease should always be ascertained. Among the gender-influenced diseases, inflammatory myopathies are more frequent in females, as observed also in the majority of autoimmune diseases; namely, polymyositis and dermatomyositis incidence is evidently higher in females, with a ratio of 2.5:1. On the contrary, inclusion body myositis (IBM), which has a peculiar degenerative component, prevales in middle-aged and older men. This is consistent with other neurodegenerative diseases, in which the female gender may have a 'protective' role, as observed in some experimental autophagic pathological processes. Other examples include FSHD, with a more favourable clinical course in females, and Pompe's disease, in which female gender seems to be related to a better therapeutical response. Finally, pregnancy may cause deterioration of the clinical course in women with muscular weakness of different origin, especially due to the additional physiological changes: a strict monitoring of the cardiac, respiratory and motor function is therefore always necessary, associated to a surveillance of possible metabolic derangements. Child delivery options are challenging in muscle disorders: a natural delivery is not indicated when respiratory, abdominal or pelvic muscle are involved, whereas Caesarean section may be safely performed with a spinal anesthesia to avoid intubation even in more affected women.

Study design Forty-four girls, ages 10 to 14 years at baseline, completed 4 years of treatment with oxandrolone (Ox) or placebo (PI). All received growth hormone and estrogen replacement therapy. We assessed the number of girls with severe learning disability (LD, standard score <= 5(th) percentile) on measures of academic arithmetic and reading achievement (WRAT-3, arithmetic and reading), given yearly, and the WIAT numerical operations (NOS) and reading subtests, given at year 4. Results On the WRAT-3 arithmetic, the frequency of severe arithmetic LD was similar in the Ox and PI groups at baseline and at years 1 and 2. At years 3 and 4, fewer girls in the Ox than PI group had a severe arithmetic LD (year 4: 0/22 vs 5/21, P = .02). On the WIAT NOS (year 4), fewer girls in the Ox than PI groups had a severe arithmetic LD (3/21 vs 8/20, P = .09). WIAT NOS error analysis suggested that the improved performance in the Ox group was associated with better performance on multiplication and division (P < .01). The frequency of severe LD for the WRAT-3 reading was similar for the Ox and PI groups (all years) and for the WIAT reading subtest (year 4). Conclusions Androgen treatment for 4 years in girls with Turner syndrome resulted in a small decrease in frequency of severe arithmetic LD, with no effect on reading LD.

This information would indicate whether or not MAO-A gene dosage could potentially explain the observed gender differences that show functional connections to the serotonin system, such as aggression and impulsiveness. To investigate the X inactivation status of MAO-A we have used primary clonal cell cultures, on which allelic expression was assessed with RFLP analysis.

We can distinguish five different patterns of mosaicism, including the phylloid pattern and the lateralization pattern. Etiologically, cutaneous mosaics can be divided into two large categories, epigenetic mosaicism and genomic mosaicism. All forms of epigenetic mosaicism known so far, including the various patterns of X-inactivation, appear to be caused by the action of retrotransposons. A new concept is functional autosomal mosaicism transmittable through the action of retrotransposons, which has been described in mice and dogs and may explain, for example, the familial occurrence of pigmentary mosaicism along the Blaschko lines in human skin. Among the examples of mosaicism of autosomal lethal mutations, phylloid hypomelanosis is a recently recognized neurocutaneous entity caused by mosaic trisomy 13. Possible examples of a type 2 segmental manifestation now include at least fifteen different autosomally dominant skin disorders. This phenomenon is most frequently found in glomangiomatosis, cutaneous leiomyomatosis, and disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis. Recently proposed examples of didymosis (twin spotting) include cutis tricolor, paired patches of excessive or absent involvement in Darier disease, and didymosis aplasticosebacea characterized by coexistent aplasia cutis congenita and nevus sebaceus. To the list of possible examples of paradominant inheritance, cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita and speckled lentiginous nevus syndrome have now been added. Revertant mosaicism giving rise to unaffected skin areas in autosomally recessive cutaneous traits will certainly likewise be recognized more often when clinicians are bearing this concept in mind.

We hypothesized that different RPGR mutations result in distinct RP phenotypes. DESIGN: Observational case series. METHODS: Fifteen members in family I and three members in family II were evaluated. Full ophthalmic evaluations were done. Linkage analyses were performed and likelihood of odds scores (LOD score) were calculated. For mutation analyses, we used dHPLC and automated sequencing. RESULTS: Two novel RPGR mutations were identified in the two families; a Glu 414 (2-bp del) frameshift mutation in family I and an IVS 2-1 (g to a) splice site mutation in family II. All male family members in family I were severely affected by RP but maintained central visual acuities until their 50s and did not develop a bull's eye maculopathy. The female phenotype was highly variable. Some of the carriers exhibited a severe phenotype, one female displayed an asymmetric phenotype, and other carriers were asymptomatic. All members with the RPGR frameshift mutation exhibited rod-cone electroretinograms abnormalities, whereas five members had hearing loss. Male members of family II were severely affected, with early visual acuity loss, central scotomas, and bull's eye maculopathy. The female family members were asymptomatic but displayed cone-rod electroretinograms changes. There was no hearing loss.

MiR-548am-5p emerged as potentially XCI escaper and was experimentally verified to be significantly up-regulated in human XX primary dermal fibroblasts (DFs) compared to XY ones. Accordingly, miR-548am-5p target mRNAs, e.g. the transcript for Bax, was differently modulated in XX and XY DFs. Functional analyses indicated that XY DFs were more prone to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis than XX ones. Experimentally induced overexpression of miR548am-5p in XY cells by lentivirus vector transduction decreased apoptosis susceptibility, whereas its down-regulation in XX cells enhanced apoptosis susceptibility. These data indicate that this approach could be used to identify previously unreported sex-biased differences in miR expression and that a miR identified with this approach, miR548am-5p, can account for sex-dependent differences observed in the susceptibility to mitochondrial apoptosis of human DFs.","2041-4889 Matarrese, Paola Tieri, Paolo Orcid: 0000-0002-3635-7664 Anticoli, Simona Ascione, Barbara Conte, Maria Franceschi, Claudio Malorni, Walter Orcid: 0000-0002-1223-7000 Salvioli, Stefano Ruggieri, Anna Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2019/09/13 Cell Death Dis. 2019 Sep 11;10(9):673. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1888-3.",10.1038/s41419-019-1888-3,"Adult;Apoptosis/*genetics;Cells, Cultured;Chromosomes, Human, X/*metabolism;Databases, Genetic;Down-Regulation/genetics;Female;Fibroblasts/*metabolism;Genes, X-Linked;Humans;Male;MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism;Mitochondria/*genetics/metabolism;Sex Characteristics;Up-Regulation/genetics;X Chromosome;Mitochondria",,

Testing for association on the X chromosome raises unique challenges that have motivated the development of X-specific statistical tests in the literature. However, to date there has been no study of these methods under a wide range of realistic study designs, allele frequencies and disease models to assess the size and power of each test. To address this, we have performed an extensive simulation study to investigate the effects of the sex ratios in the case and control cohorts, as well as the allele frequencies, on the size and power of eight test statistics under three different disease models that each account for X-inactivation. We show that existing, but under-used, methods that make use of both male and female data are uniformly more powerful than popular methods that make use of only female data. In particular, we show that Clayton's one degree of freedom statistic [Clayton, 2008] is robust and powerful across a wide range of realistic simulation parameters. Our results provide guidance on selecting the most appropriate test statistic to analyse X chromosome data from GWAS and show that much power can be gained by a more careful analysis of X chromosome GWAS data.","1098-2272 Hickey, Peter F Bahlo, Melanie Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2011/08/06 Genet Epidemiol. 2011 Nov;35(7):664-70. doi: 10.1002/gepi.20616.

The objective of this study was to evaluate evidence for causes of high F/M ratios of autoimmune and non-immunologic diseases. This was done by a literature review. Some thyroid, rheumatic and hepatic diseases consistently have high F/M ratios; other autoimmune diseases have low ratios. Because F/M ratios reflect disease incidence, not disease severity, an intrinsic biologic cause for the F/M ratios (such as estrogen) would be likely to act through a threshold or permissive mechanism rather than through quantitative immunomodulation. Sex differences related to environmental exposure, X-inactivation, imprinting, X or Y chromosome genes and intrauterine influences are other possible explanations for sex differences of incidence.

SLE incidence in female is substantially higher than males, but males tend to have more severe manifestations including greater risk of lupus nephritis (LN). Aberrant genetic expression of immune cells plays a vital role in pathogenesis of SLE and may explain gender diapariesties. We conducted bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SLE females and males with and without LN to identify gene differences and possible sex-tailored treatment. The gene expression profiling datasets (GSE 99967) were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo and analyzed by GEO2R platform. GSE 99967 used ffymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array and mRNA from whole blood. The t-test was done and adjusted P-value < 0.03 by Benjamini & Hochberg method was a threshold for statistically significant DEGs. 15 and 13 DEGs were obtained comparing SLE females with SLE males without and with LN, respectively. 13 common genes identified in both comparisons. XIST was the only down-regulated gene in male, located at X chromosome and responsible for initiation and spread of X-inactivation. X inactivation provides XIST dosage equivalence between genders. This suggested altered X-chromosome inactivation lead to female bias in SLE. Of 12 common up-regulated genes in male, 10 located at Y chromosome and showed a decrease up-regulated in SLE males with LN compare to without.

Change in UTY and USP9Y expression may associate with developing LN and drugs modifying their expression might benefit in treatment or prevention of LN in SLE males. The study enhanced an understanding of SLE sexual bias. Aberrant XIST inactivation may cause different incidence of SLE among gender. Drugs changing XIST expression might cure SLE.

Extension to X-chromosomal SNPs faces several analytical challenges including dosage compensation via X-inactivation and allelic heterogeneity. Focusing on Levene's test to detect phenotypic variance differences associated with the genotype groups of an X-chromosome SNP, we first note that sex can be an inherent confounder; sex necessarily correlates with the number of minor allele of the SNP, and it could also correlate, through both mean and variance, with the distribution of quantitative traits that exhibit sexual dimorphism, such as height and BMI. We then show theoretically that the naïve 3-group analytical strategy combining the genotypes of females and males could lead to spurious variance signals through confounding.

Men and women respond similarly to infection and vaccination, which suggests that the intrinsic differences in immune response between the sexes do not account for differences in disease frequency. In autoimmune-like illnesses caused by recognized environmental agents, sex discrepancy is usually explained by differences in exposure. Because the beginnings of autoimmune diseases can be identified decades before clinical illness, a causative factor also would have to be sought decades before illness. Endogenous hormones are not a likely explanation for sex discrepancy; hormones could have an effect if the effect is a threshold rather than quantitative.

In this manuscript, we evaluate the hypothesis that qualitative or quantitative differences in circulating antibodies may explain, at least in part, the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and its sex bias-especially when considering an evolutionary perspective. Indeed, women have higher absolute levels of antibodies than men, and (auto)antibodies are also associated with most autoimmune diseases. Several facts suggest differences in antibodies may cause increased prevalence of autoimmune disease in women. First, the association between increased quantities of serum antibodies and increased prevalence of autoimmunity is found not only in women, but also in men with Klinefelter syndrome. Second, both serum antibody levels and autoimmunity spike in the postpartum period. Third, a dose-response effect exists between parity and both serum antibodies and prevalence of autoimmune disease. Fourth, many biologically plausible mechanisms explain the association, such as T cell-dependent activation of B cells and/or VGLL3. The evolutionary underpinning of increased antibodies in women is likely to be protection of offspring from infections.

Evidence acquisition: Using the PubMed database, this narrative review evaluates published findings from mouse model-based and clinical cohort studies to identify factors associated with sex and clinical outcomes in bladder cancer. A scoping review of the key findings on epidemiology, genetic, hormonal, immune physiology, and clinical outcomes was performed to explore potential factors that could have implications in immunomodulatory therapy design. Evidence synthesis: Sex-associated differences in UCB incidence and clinical outcomes are influenced by sex hormones, local bladder resident immune populations, tumor genetics, and bladder microbiome. In the context of therapeutic outcomes, sex differences are prominent in response to bacillus Calmette-Guérin immunotherapy used in the treatment of non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Similarly, with respect to tumor molecular profiles in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, tumors from females show enrichment of the basal subtype. Conclusions: Among proposed tumor/host intrinsic factors that may influence response to immune-based therapies, patient sex remains a challenging consideration that deserves further attention. Evidence to date supports a multifactorial origin of sexual dimorphism in the incidence and outcomes of UCB. Patient summary: In this review, we highlight the sex-associated host and tumor intrinsic features that may potentially drive differential disease progression and therapeutic response in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Sexual dimorphism in bladder cancer incidence and clinical outcomes is well established. Significant differences in sex-associated physiological immune responses play critical roles in response to conventional and novel immunotherapy for bladder cancer.",L2007885093 2020-09-25,10.1016/j.euo.2020.08.013,androgen;androgen receptor;estrogen receptor alpha;sex hormone;steroid 5alpha reductase inhibitor;tamoxifen;adaptive immunity;bladder cancer;bladder microbiome;cancer genetics;cancer immunotherapy;cancer incidence;cancer survival;cancer therapy;clinical outcome;environmental factor;gene expression regulation;gene mutation;human;immune response;immunobiology;immunomodulation;innate immunity;intrinsic activity;microflora;nonhuman;priority journal;protein function;review;sex difference;survival rate;transitional cell carcinoma;treatment outcome;treatment response;X chromosome inactivation;Urinary Bladder Neoplasms;Sex Characteristics,,

At the onset of XCI, Xist RNA accumulates on one of two Xs, coating and silencing the chromosome in cis. The molecular basis for monoallelic Xist upregulation is not known, though evidence predominantly supports a posttranscriptional mechanism through RNA stabilization. Here, we test whether Tsix RNA destabilizes Xist RNA. Unexpectedly, we find that Xist upregulation is not based on transcript stabilization at all but is instead controlled by transcription in a sex-specific manner. Tsix directly regulates its transcription. On the future inactive X, Tsix downregulation induces a transient heterochromatic state in Xist, followed paradoxically by high-level Xist expression. A Tsix-deficient X chromosome adopts the heterochromatic state in pre-XCI cells. This state persists through XCI establishment and ""reverts"" to a euchromatic state during XCI maintenance. We have therefore identified chromatin marks that preempt and predict asymmetric Xist expression. ©2006 Elsevier Inc.",L43290729 2006-03-21,10.1016/j.molcel.2006.01.028,allele;article;chromatin;DNA methylation;down regulation;female;gene expression;gene silencing;genetic transcription;male;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;posttranscriptional gene silencing;RNA stability;sex determination;upregulation;RNA,,

We note that this would result from a simple additive effect of X-linked intelligence genes and also discuss the potentially important contribution of recessive deleterious loci. The buffering effect of heterozygosity in females will be partly constrained by the skewing of X-inactivation patterns increasing the variance of females beyond what is expected. Furthermore, escape of some X-linked genes from in-activation may also be relevant to male-female variance comparisons. We also comment on the difficulty of establishing the extent to which the X chromosome is enriched for intelligence genes and point out that their estimates of the proportion of genes influencing general intelligence that might be located on the X chromosome rely on some doubtful premises, especially concerning the likely equivalence of X-linked gene action in males and females.

There is an overwhelming consensus that there is a massive male preponderance in this type of CD and that biological variables are major influences on this difference.

It is generally believed that the female advantage is associated with the effects of sex hormones. This review argues that the sex benefit of females during the host response is associated with polymorphism of X-linked genes and cellular mosaicism for X-linked parental alleles. Cells from females carry both parental X chromosomes (maternal, Xm; or paternal, Xp), whereas males carry only one (Xm). Because of dosage compensation and random X inactivation, half of the cells from females express either Xm or Xp. Therefore, females are cellular mosaics for their X-linked polymorphic genes. This cellular mosaicism in females represents a more adaptive and balanced cellular machinery that is advantageous during the innate immune response. Several genes encoding key metabolic and regulatory proteins reside on the X chromosome, including members of the apoptotic cascade, hormone homeostasis, glucose metabolic enzymes, superoxide-producing machinery, and the toll-like receptor/nuclear factor κB/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway. Polymorphic forms of these X-linked proteins are likely to manifest in phenotypic differences in the mosaic cell populations in females and may contribute to sex-related differences in the host response to injury and infection. The unique inheritance pattern of X-linked polymorphisms and their potential confounding effects in clinical trials are also discussed; furthermore, we present potential biomarkers for studying mosaic cell populations of innate immunity. ©2007The Shock Society.",L46788157 2007-06-01,10.1097/SHK.0b013e31802e40bd,DNA;immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein;stress activated protein kinase;toll like receptor;apoptosis;cell population;chromosome mosaicism;DNA polymorphism;gene expression;gene frequency;genetic trait;glucose metabolism;heritability;heterozygosity;human;immune response;inflammatory disease;innate immunity;metabolic regulation;phenotypic plasticity;phenotypic variation;review;septic shock;sex difference;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Inflammation,,

Recently, we elucidated the underlying gene defect by demonstrating point mutations in NSDHL (NAD[P]H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein) at Xq28 in 6 patients with classic CHILD syndrome. The most striking clinical feature is an inflammatory nevus that usually shows a unique lateralization with strict midline demarcation. Ipsilateral defects involve all skeletal structures and internal organs such as the brain, the lung, the heart, or the kidney. As an exception to this rule, in some cases the CHILD nevus may occur in a more or less bilateral distribution. In 1997 Fink-Puches et al described a case of CHILD nevus with an almost symmetric arrangement. To test the correctness of the diagnosis, we now examined blood lymphocytes of this patient by single-strand conformation analysis and genomic sequencing. We identified a novel missense mutation in NSDHL that potentially may impair protein function. We conclude that a diagnosis of CHILD syndrome can be based on clinical features such as the highly characteristic morphology of the CHILD nevus. A symmetric distribution of this nevus can exceptionally be seen in patients with CHILD syndrome, and this bilateral involvement should not mislead the clinician to any other diagnosis.

To determine whether a foreign gene inserted into the X chromosome is subject to inactivation, transgenic mice harboring 11 copies of the complete, 17-kilobase chicken transferrin gene on the X chromosome were used. Male mice hemizygous for this insert were bred with females bearing Searle's translocation, an X-chromosome rearrangement that is always active in heterozygous females (the unrearranged X chromosome is inactive). Female offspring bearing the Searle's translocation and the chicken transferrin gene had the same amount of chicken transferrin messenger RNA in liver as did transgenic male mice or transgenic female mice lacking the Searle's chromosome.

In this review, we describe the advantages and limitations of genetic methodologies, and how these methods have been used to discover candidate genes in smaller populations of pediatric patients. We also introduce novel concepts for nontraditional modes of genetic inheritance that may be important in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Recent findings Candidate genes identified by linkage analyses and genome-wide association scans in adult populations have led to focused genetic studies in pediatric populations. Some genes are associated with subsets of both adult and pediatric patients; others appear to be age specific. Novel concepts in genetics have uncovered potential contributions of maternal compared with paternal transmission, noninherited maternal alleles that may work through maternal microchimerism, and sex-specific epigenetic mechanisms of immunoregulation. Summary Advancing methods are leading to the discovery of genes associated with childhood autoimmune diseases.

Here we show that sex differences in polyamine metabolism are associated with escape from X chromosome inactivation of the gene encoding spermine synthase (SMS). Female placental trophoblasts demonstrate biallelic SMS expression, associated with increased SMS mRNA and enzyme activity. Polyamine depletion in primary trophoblasts reduced glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation resulting in decreased acetyl-coA availability and global histone hypoacetylation in a sex-dependent manner. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-sequencing identifies progesterone biosynthesis as a target of polyamine regulated gene expression, and polyamine depletion reduced progesterone release in male trophoblasts. The effects of polyamine depletion can be attributed to spermine as SMS-silencing recapitulated the effects on energy metabolism, histone acetylation, and progesterone release. In summary, spermine metabolism alters trophoblast gene expression through acetyl-coA biosynthesis and histone acetylation, and SMS escape from X inactivation explains some features of human placental sex differences.","2399-3642 Aye, Irving L M H Orcid: 0000-0003-3400-5005 Gong, Sungsam Orcid: 0000-0001-5796-4423 Avellino, Giulia Orcid: 0000-0002-7413-0217 Barbagallo, Roberta Gaccioli, Francesca Orcid: 0000-0001-7178-8921 Jenkins, Benjamin J Orcid: 0000-0003-0038-9709 Koulman, Albert Orcid: 0000-0001-9998-051x Murray, Andrew J Orcid: 0000-0002-0929-9315 Stephen Charnock-Jones, D Orcid: 0000-0002-2936-4890 Smith, Gordon C S Orcid: 0000-0003-2124-0997 DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2022/06/16 Commun Biol. 2022 Jun 15;5(1):586. doi: 10.1038/s42003-022-03530-6.",10.1038/s42003-022-03530-6,Acetyl Coenzyme A/metabolism;Acetylation;Female;Gene Expression;*Histones/genetics/metabolism;Humans;Male;Placenta/metabolism;Polyamines/metabolism;Pregnancy;Progesterone/metabolism;Spermine;*Trophoblasts/metabolism,,

Emerging research suggests that nonhormonal factors, such as the XX or XY sex chromosome complement and sex bias in gene expression, may also lead to sex-based differences in PAH incidence, penetrance, and progression. Typically, one of females' two X chromosomes is epigenetically silenced to offer a gender-balanced gene expression. Recent data demonstrate that the long noncoding RNA X-inactive specific transcript, essential for X chromosome inactivation and dosage compensation of X-linked gene expression, shows elevated levels in female PAH lung specimens compared with controls. This molecular event leads to incomplete inactivation of the females' second X chromosome, abnormal expression of X-linked gene(s) involved in PAH pathophysiology, and a pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) proliferative phenotype. Moreover, the pathogenic proliferative p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/ETS transcription factor ELK1 (Elk1)/cFos signaling is mechanistically linked to the sexually dimorphic proliferative response of PAECs in PAH. Apprehending the complicated relationship between long noncoding RNA X-inactive specific transcript and X-linked genes and how this relationship integrates into a sexually dimorphic proliferation of PAECs and PAH sex paradox remain challenging. We highlight herein new findings related to how the sex chromosome complement and sex-differentiated epigenetic mechanisms to control gene expression are decisive players in the sexual dimorphism of PAH.

T. and Koelsch, K. A. and Scofield, R. H.",,,,,"Background:CXorf21 and SLC15a4 both contain risk alleles for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). The former escapes X inactivation. Our group predicts specific endolysosomal-dependent immune responses are driven by the protein products of these genes, which form a complex at the endolysosomal surface. Our previous studies have shown that knocking out CXorf21 increases lysosomal pH in female monocytes, and the present study assesses whether the lysosomal pH in 46,XX women, who overexpress CXorf21 in monocytes, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs), differs from 46,XY men. Methods: To determine endolysosome compartment pH we used both LysoSensor™ Yellow/Blue DND-160 and pHrodo® Red AM Intracellular pH Indicator in primary monocyte, B cells, DCs, NK cells, and T cells from healthy men and women volunteers. Results: Compared to male samples, female monocytes, B cells, and DCs had lower endolysosomal pH (female/male pH value: monocytes 4.9/5.6 p < 0.0001; DCs 4.9/5.7 p = 0.044; B cells 5.0/5.6 p < 0.05). Interestingly, T cells and NK cells, which both express low levels of CXorf21, showed no differential pH levels between men and women. Conclusion: We have previously shown that subjects with two or more X-chromosomes have increased CXorf21 expression in specific primary immune cells. Moreover, knockdown of CXorf21 increases lysosomal pH in female monocytes. The present data show that female monocytes, DC, B cells, where CXorf21 is robustly expressed, have lower lysosomal pH compared to the same immune cell populations from males. The lower pH levels observed in specific female immune cells provide a function to these SLE/SS-associated genes and a mechanism for the reported inflated endolysosomal-dependent immune response observed in women compared to men (i.e., TLR7/type I Interferon activity).","1664-3224 Harris, Valerie M Harley, Isaac T W Kurien, Biji T Koelsch, Kristi A Scofield, Robert Hal U54 GM104938/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States U19 AI082714/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States P30 AR053483/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States P30 AR073750/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States T32 AR007534/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States I01 BX001451/BX/BLRD VA/United States R01 AR053734/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

Sex and SNP coefficient biases were observed when assumptions made about XCI and sex differences in SNP effect in the analysis model were inconsistent with the data-generating model. However, including a SNP-sex interaction term often eliminated these biases. To illustrate these findings, estimates under different genetic model assumptions are compared and interpreted in a real data example. Models to analyze X chromosome SNPs make assumptions beyond those made in autosomal variant analysis. Assumptions made about X chromosome SNP effects should be stated clearly when reporting and interpreting X chromosome associations.

The phenotypes associated with DDX3X variants are heterogeneous and include brain and behavioral abnormalities, microcephaly, hypotonia, and movement disorders and/or spasticity. The majority of DDX3X variants described are de novo mutations in females with ID. In contrast, most male DDX3X variants are inherited from an unaffected mother, with one documented exception being a recently identified de novo splice site variant. It has been suggested, therefore, that DDX3X exerts its effects through haploinsufficiency in females, and that affected males carry hypomorphic alleles that retain partial function. Given the lack of male de novo DDX3X variants, loss-of-function variants in this gene are suspected to be male lethal. Through whole-exome sequencing, we identified three unrelated males with hemizygous missense DDX3X variants and ID. All three variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, with two established as de novo. In silico analyses were supportive of pathogenicity. We report the male phenotypes and compare them to phenotypes observed in previously reported male and female patients.

The mice used for this work combined a spontaneous mutation of the Sty gene with a transgene for Sty that is incorporated into an autosome thus disassociating gonad differentiation from sex chromosome complement. The resulting genotypes are XX and XY- females (ovary-bearing) along with XXSry and XY(-)Sry males (testes-bearing). Here we report results of basic behavioral phenotyping conducted with these mice. Motor coordination, use of olfactory cues to find a food item, general activity, foot shock threshold, and behavior in an elevated plus maze were not affected by gonadal sex or sex chromosome complement. In a one-way active avoidance learning task females were faster to escape an electric shock than males. In addition, sex chromosome complement differences were noted during social interactions with submissive intruders. Female XY- mice were faster to follow an intruder than XX female mice. All XY- mice spent more time sniffing and grooming the intruder than the XX mice, with XY- females spending the most amount of time in this activity. Finally, XX females were faster to display an asocial behavior, digging, and engaged in more digging than XXSry male mice. All of these behaviors were tested in gonadectomized adults, thus, differences in circulating levels of gonadal steroids cannot account for these effects.

Furthermore, these differentially expressed sex chromosome transcripts can regulate the transcription of autosomal genes, leading to a large transcriptional sexual dimorphism.

It has long been assumed that a large proportion of recurrent spontaneous abortion results from genetic problems, but no causative genes have been identified to date. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a subset of women with recurrent spontaneous abortion are carriers of X-linked recessive disorders that result in the loss of male pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: X chromosome inactivation patterns, an assay used to detect women who are likely to be carriers of X-linked recessive cell-lethal traits, were compared between 105 female patients with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss and 101 women (control subjects) with a single successful pregnancy and no history of pregnancy loss. Inheritance patterns and gender of offspring were studied in relevant subsets of participants. RESULTS: Female patients showed a highly statistically significant increase in the frequency of skewed X chromosome inactivation (90%; P < .0005). Female patients with highly skewed X chromosome inactivation showed a significant decrease in male children. Four of 6 families that were studied showed maternal inheritance of the skewed inactivation trait. CONCLUSION: We found the 14% of women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss show highly skewed X inactivation, which suggests that they are carriers of X-linked recessive lethal traits. Furthermore, the observed gender bias among women with highly skewed X inactivation suggests selective loss of male conceptions, which is consistent with an X chromosome-linked genetic defect that leads to cell death or growth disadvantage. Identification of such female carriers is important for the reproductive counseling and treatment of these women.","Lanasa, M C Hogge, W A Kubik, C J Ness, R B Harger, J Nagel, T Prosen, T Markovic, N Hoffman, E P NICHD38126/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

This “Bedside to Bench to Bedside” approach based on sex differences in MS will be reviewed here, first for disease susceptibility then for disability progression.",L2004120161 2020-01-31 2020-04-29,10.1177/1352458519892491,androgen receptor;estriol;glatiramer;glycoprotein p 15095;interleukin 10;interleukin 13;testosterone;toll like receptor 7;transcription factor FOXP3;autoimmune encephalomyelitis;article;autoimmune disease;bisulfite sequencing;CD4+ T lymphocyte;degenerative disease;disease exacerbation;disease predisposition;disease severity;DNA methylation;Expanded Disability Status Scale;gene deletion;gene frequency;gene locus;genome-wide association study;gonadectomy;human;immune response;incidence;multiple sclerosis;nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;phenotype;pseudoautosomal region;risk factor;sex chromosome;sex difference;upregulation;X chromosome inactivation;X linked mental retardation;Y chromosome;Disease Progression;Multiple Sclerosis,,

The objectives of this work were to confirm that unusual inheritance and to investigate non-Mendelian genetic effects that may influence differences in Brahman × Simmental crossbred calves. Crossbred calves were produced by embryo transfer ( = 2,862) and natural service or artificial insemination ( = 2,125) from 1983 to 1991 by a private seedstock producer. Brahman-sired F embryos out of Simmental donors weighed 9.4 ± 1.1 ( < 0.001) kg more at birth than Simmental-sired F embryos out of Brahman donor cows when transferred to comparable recipients. This reciprocal difference was accompanied by sexual dimorphism: within Brahman-sired F calves, males were 5.0 ± 1.4 kg heavier than females, whereas within Simmental-sired F calves, females were 0.7 ± 0.5 kg heavier than males. Covariates were constructed from the pedigree to represent genetic effects: proportion Brahman in calves and dams (direct and maternal breed effects), direct and maternal breed heterozygosity, probability of Brahman mitochondrial origin, probability of Brahman Y chromosome, probability of Brahman X chromosome, genomic imprinting (the difference between the probabilities of Brahman in the genetic dam and in the sire), nonrandom X inactivation by breed of origin (the probability of breed heterozygosity of the X chromosomes of a female), and nonrandom X inactivation by parent of origin (the difference between probabilities of a female inheriting a paternal or maternal Brahman X chromosome).

Whilst ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is recognized as the main etiological factor, the relationship between exposure and host phenotype is still unclear. We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane databases for studies assessing the genetic basis of host response to UVR DNA damage, the effect of UVR on generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and their detoxification, UVR induced skin immunity modifications, and the role of genomic instability with a focus on the potential use of these biomarkers to the surgical treatment planning and prognosis of BCC patients. Data suggest that risk for BCC development is likely to result from the combined effect of many genes, each with a relatively weak individual contribution. Certain genomic alterations have been associated with increased or reduced risk for BCC development, with a second primary BCC or with recurrence of BCC. However, use of these biomarkers in everyday practice should be supported by further studies, mainly for its cost-effectiveness. In addition, not enough information exists on the prognostic value of existing demographic and clinical risk predictors for BCC regarding development of second primary or recurrent tumors. Information reviewed suggests that these predictors are of higher predictive value compared with biomarkers whilst they are indisputably cheaper and easier to monitor even in developing countries. Conclusively, we suggest that further studies aimed in investigating second primary or recurrent BCC are needed to provide better information on the predictive value of certain demographic, clinical and histological factors. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Failure to analyze X-chromosome data at all is obviously less than ideal, and can lead to missed discoveries. Even when X-chromosome data are included, they are often analyzed with suboptimal statistics. Several mathematically sensible statistics for X-chromosome association have been proposed. The optimality of these statistics, however, is based on very specific simple genetic models. In addition, while previous simulation studies of these statistics have been informative, they have focused on single-marker tests and have not considered the types of error that occur even under the null hypothesis when the entire X chromosome is scanned. In this study, we comprehensively tested several X-chromosome association statistics using simulation studies that include the entire chromosome. We also considered a wide range of trait models for sex differences and phenotypic effects of X inactivation. We found that models that do not incorporate a sex effect can have large type I error in some cases.

This phenomenon is due to a finite period during preimplantation development when both X chromosomes are active, between embryonic genome activation and X chromosome inactivation, around the blastocyst stage. Consequently, prior to implantation male and female embryos exhibit differences in their cellular phenotype. Manifestations of such differences include altered total activity of specific X-linked enzymes and the metabolic pathways they regulate. Subsequently, one would expect to be able to determine differences in the rate of consumption and utilization of specific nutrients between male and female embryos. Data to date on animal models support this, with sex-specific differences in glucose and amino acid utilization being reported for the mouse and cow blastocysts. Such differences in metabolic phenotype may logically be involved in the reported differences in growth rates between preimplantation embryos of different sex. As the fields of proteomics and metabolomics are being increasingly applied to human assisted con-ception it is prudent to consider how such technologies may be applied to identify sex differences in the human embryo. Such data would have implications far beyond current invasive technologies used to identify the sex of an embryo conceived in vitro for the diagnosis of X-linked diseases. © The Author 2010.

There is an unexplained, strong male preponderance of individuals with the ATMDS phenotype with a >5:1 male-female ratio and furthermore, all the somatic ATRX mutations described to date have been in males. Here we report the identification, in a single centre, of two females with ATMDS and mutations in the ATRX gene, proving that ATMDS associated with such mutations may occur, albeit rarely, in females. It seemed possible that females might be less likely to develop ATMDS if the inactivated copy of the ATRX gene (ATRX) became progressively re-activated throughout life.

These mechanisms include upregulation of the heterogametic chromosome as well as repression in the homogametic sex. Remarkably, strategies for dosage compensation differ between species. In organisms where more is known about molecular mechanisms of dosage compensation, specific protein complexes containing noncoding RNAs are targeted to the X chromosome.

Previous studies have identified epigenetic differences between sexes in some human tissues. However, it is unclear whether epigenetic modifications contribute to sex-specific differences in insulin secretion and metabolism. Here, we investigate the impact of sex on the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in human pancreatic islets from 53 males and 34 females, and relate the methylome to changes in expression and insulin secretion. RESULTS: Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is higher in female versus male islets. Genome-wide DNA methylation data in human islets clusters based on sex. While the chromosome-wide DNA methylation level on the X-chromosome is higher in female versus male islets, the autosomes do not display a global methylation difference between sexes. Methylation of 8,140 individual X-chromosome sites and 470 autosomal sites shows sex-specific differences in human islets. These include sites in/near AR, DUSP9, HNF4A, BCL11A and CDKN2B. 61 X-chromosome genes and 18 autosomal genes display sex-specific differences in both DNA methylation and expression. These include NKAP, SPESP1 and APLN, which exhibited lower expression in females. Functional analyses demonstrate that methylation of NKAP and SPESP1 promoters in vitro suppresses their transcriptional activity. Silencing of Nkap or Apln in clonal beta-cells results in increased insulin secretion. Differential methylation between sexes is associated with altered levels of microRNAs miR-660 and miR-532 and related target genes.

However, the intracellular molecular mechanisms that drive these clinically important sex differences remain underexplored. METHODS: Hydrogel biomaterials were designed to recapitulate key aspects of the valve tissue microenvironment and to serve as a culture platform for sex-specific valvular interstitial cells (VICs; precursors to profibrotic myofibroblasts). The hydrogel culture system was used to interrogate intracellular pathways involved in sex-dependent VIC-to-myofibroblast activation and deactivation. RNA sequencing was used to define pathways involved in driving sex-dependent activation. Interventions with small molecule inhibitors and siRNA transfections were performed to provide mechanistic insight into sex-specific cellular responses to microenvironmental cues, including matrix stiffness and exogenously delivered biochemical factors. RESULTS: In both healthy porcine and human aortic valves, female leaflets had higher baseline activation of the myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin compared with male leaflets. When isolated and cultured, female porcine and human VICs had higher levels of basal α-smooth muscle actin stress fibers that further increased in response to the hydrogel matrix stiffness, both of which were higher than in male VICs. A transcriptomic analysis of male and female porcine VICs revealed Rho-associated protein kinase signaling as a potential driver of this sex-dependent myofibroblast activation. Furthermore, we found that genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation such as BMX and STS (encoding for Bmx nonreceptor tyrosine kinase and steroid sulfatase, respectively) partially regulate the elevated female myofibroblast activation through Rho-associated protein kinase signaling. This finding was confirmed by treating male and female VICs with endothelin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, factors that are secreted by endothelial cells and known to drive myofibroblast activation through Rho-associated protein kinase signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Together, in vivo and in vitro results confirm sex dependencies in myofibroblast activation pathways and implicate genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation in regulating sex differences in myofibroblast activation and subsequent aortic valve stenosis progression. Our results underscore the importance of considering sex as a biological variable to understand the molecular mechanisms of aortic valve stenosis and to help guide sex-based precision therapies.",L637034332 2022-02-01 2022-03-07,10.1161/circulationaha.121.054108,actin;biological marker;transcriptome;animal;aortic valve;aortic valve stenosis;cell culture;cytology;disease model;drug effect;female;gene expression;gene expression regulation;genetics;human;immunohistochemistry;male;metabolism;myofibroblast;pathology;pig;sex factor;signal transduction;X chromosomal inheritance;X chromosome inactivation;Sex Characteristics;X Chromosome,,

Biochemical evidence based on increasing hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) activity during the mouse morula stage indicates that at least one X chromosome is functional. This is corroborated by the observation that mouse embryos lacking an X chromosome do not survive beyond the early cleavage stages. The principal approach to determining whether both X chromosomes are functional before inactivation has been to look at the distributions of the activities of known X-linked enzymes in individual embryos. A bimodal distribution would be expected if dosage compensation had not yet occurred and female embryos with two X chromosomes made twice as much enzyme as male embryos with only one. However, identities of the embryos being assayed are not known, and conclusions based on activity distributions are necessarily inferential. We have circumvented this difficulty by using a method which facilitates determination of the sex of the embryonic material being assayed. This has led to the demonstration that early male and female mouse blastocysts differ twofold in HGPRT activity, a finding indicative of uncompensated X-chromosome dosage dependent gene activity before X-chromosome inactivation.",L8396817 1978-12-11,,animal experiment;blastocyst;gene activity;heredity;histology;in vitro study;mouse;sex difference;X chromatin;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome,,

Such alterations might also be involved in the sex-related growth differences in preimplantation embryos found in some animal species. In the present study we analysed cell numbers of human male and female surplus embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage after either IVF or ICSI in order to investigate possible sex-dependent differential growth rates. Methods: Blastocysts resulting from surplus embryos obtained after either IVF or ICSI during a 5 year study period were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: The number of cells and sex could be determined in 330 blastocysts collected from 92 IVF cycles and in 322 blastocysts collected from 121 ICSI cycles. Whereas female and male embryos originating from IVF showed comparable mean log cell numbers per embryo ± SEM (3.76 ± 0.05 in 147 female and 3.72 ± 0.04 in 183 male embryos), significant differences were observed in embryos originating from ICSI (3.57 ± 0.05 in 162 female and 3.90 ± 0.03 in 160 male embryos). The sex-related growth difference was significantly greater in ICSI than in IVF embryos. In a subset of 84 embryos, inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) were analysed separately. A significantly higher mean log cell number of TE cells in ICSI male embryos was found as compared to their female counterparts (3.44 ± 0.12 in 16 female and 3.90 ± 0.11 in 29 male embryos), whereas this difference was not found in IVF embryos. Conclusion: A clear sex-related growth difference was found in human blastocysts originating from ICSI, but not in blastocysts originating from IVF. It is as yet unknown which mechanism is responsible for our findings.

Here, we reanalyzed bovine blastocyst microarray expression data from a network perspective with a focus on interactions between X chromosome and autosomal genes. Whereas male-to-female ratios of expression of autosomal genes were distributed around a mean of 1, X chromosome genes were clearly shifted towards higher expression in females. We generated gene coexpression networks and identified a major module of genes with correlated gene expression that includes female-biased X genes and sexually dimorphic autosomal genes for which the sexual dimorphism is likely driven by the X genes. In this module, expression of X chromosome genes correlates with autosome genes, more than the expression of autosomal genes with each other.

Finally, we propose that changes in reproductive ecology in industrialized environments exacerbate these evolved sex differences, resulting in the increasing risk of autoimmune disease observed in females, and a counteracting reduction in diseases such as cancer that can be combated by heightened immune surveillance.

Although this field of investigation is still in its infancy, available data suggest a key role of sexual chromosomes in determining cell life or death. In particular, cells carrying XX chromosomes exhibit a higher adaptive potential and survival behavior in response to microenvironmental variations with respect to XY cells. Cells from females also appear to be equipped with more efficient epigenetic machinery than the male counterpart. In particular, the X chromosome contains an unexpected high number of microRNAs (miRs), at present 118, in comparison with only two miRs localized on chromosome Y, and an average of 40-50 on the autosomes. The regulatory power of these small non-coding RNAs is well recognized, as 30-50% of all protein-coding genes are targeted by miRs and their role in cell fate has been well demonstrated. In addition, several further insights, including DNA methylation patterns that are different in males and females, claim for a significant gender disparity in cancer and in the immune system activity against tumors.

SLE is one of many autoimmune disorders that have a strong gender bias, with 70-90% of SLE patients being female. Several explanations have been postulated to account for the severity of autoimmune diseases in females, including hormonal, microbiota, and gene dosage differences. X-linked toll-like receptors (TLRs) have recently been implicated in disease progression in females. Our previous studies using the 564Igi mouse model of SLE on a Tlr7 and Tlr9 double knockout background showed that the presence of Tlr8 on both X chromosomes was required for the production of IgG autoantibodies, Ifn-I expression and granulopoiesis in females. Here, we show the results of our investigation into the role of Tlr8 expression in SLE pathogenesis in 564Igi females. Female mice have an increase in serum pathogenic anti-RNA IgG2a and IgG2b autoantibodies. 564Igi mice have also been shown to have an increase in neutrophils in vivo, which are major contributors to Ifn-α expression. Here, we show that neutrophils from C57BL/6 mice express Ifn-α in response to 564 immune complexes and TLR8 activation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from 564Igi females have a significant increase in Tlr8 expression compared to male-derived cells, and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization data suggest that Tlr8 may escape X-inactivation in female-derived macrophages. These results propose a model by which females may be more susceptible to SLE pathogenesis due to inefficient inactivation of Tlr8.","1664-3224 McDonald, Gabrielle Cabal, Nicholas Vannier, Augustin Umiker, Benjamin Yin, Raymund H Orjalo, Arturo V Jr Johansson, Hans E Han, Jin-Hwan Imanishi-Kari, Thereza R01 AI045104/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States R01 AI076409/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Switzerland 2015/10/07 Front Immunol. 2015 Sep 8;6:457. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2015.00457. eCollection 2015.",10.3389/fimmu.2015.00457,"Ifn-i;Sle;Tlr8;X-inactivation;neutrophils;Toll-Like Receptors;Bias (Epidemiology);Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic",,

In contrast, using the same criteria, we identify a low amount of sex-biased genes in neocortex (17), hippocampus (12) and eye (22), most of which are encoded on sex chromosomes. A group of these sex-linked genes are biased in the same way on several of the tissues investigated. These shared genes encode Y-chromosome located genes, as well as X-chromosome encoded transcripts known to escape inactivation in the silenced X-chromosome. Alongside with them, we identify five novel X-linked transcripts with up-regulation in several female tissues.

Recent observations have highlighted a critical role of XIAP for the regulation of NOD2 signaling and are probably the molecular basis for increasingly recognized further immune dysregulatory symptoms of XIAP deficient patients, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We describe a large Caucasian family in which IBD and erythema nodosum (EN) also manifested in female carriers of XIAP mutations. METHODS: Clinical data and laboratory findings including flow cytometric analysis of XIAP protein expression and sequencing of the BIRC4 gene. NOD2 signaling was investigated by determination of TNFα production in monocytes upon L18-MDP stimulation in vitro. RESULTS: The BIRC4 nonsense mutation p.P225SfsX226 was identified as the genetic cause of XIAP deficiency in our family. Surprisingly, clinical symptoms were not restricted to male patients, but also occurred in several female carriers. The most severely affected carrier demonstrated random X-inactivation, leading to a significant expression of mutated XIAP protein in monocytes, and consequently to impaired NOD2 responses in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our report provides further evidence that clinical symptoms of XIAP deficiency are not restricted to male patients. Random X-inactivation may be associated with EN and mild IBD also in female carriers of BIRC4 mutations. Analysis of the X-inactivation pattern reflected by XIAP protein expression can identify such carriers and the analysis of NOD2 signaling by flow cytometry can confirm the functional significance. XIAP expression patterns should be investigated in female patients with a family history of EN and/or IBD.","1573-2592 Dziadzio, Magdalena Ammann, Sandra Canning, Claire Boyle, Fiona Hassan, Amel Cale, Cathy Elawad, Mamoun Fiil, Berthe Katrine Gyrd-Hansen, Mads Salzer, Ulrich Speckmann, Carsten Grimbacher, Bodo Case Reports Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Netherlands 2015/05/07 J Clin Immunol. 2015 Jul;35(5):439-44. doi: 10.1007/s10875-015-0166-0.

Studies performed in yeast, worms, flies and mice subjected to genetic and pharmacological interventions have given insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with longevity. Furthermore, it is now possible to effectively modulate pathways that slow aging at different stages of life (early life or at an adult age). Interestingly, interventions that extend longevity in adult mice have had sex-specific success, suggesting a potential link between particular pathways that modulate aging and sex. For example, reduction of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis at an adult age extends lifespan preferentially in females. Moreover, several postnatal dietary interventions tested by the ‘Intervention Testing Program (ITP)’ from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) have shown that while pharmacological interventions like rapamycin affect the IGF-1/insulin pathway and preferentially extend lifespan in females; dietary compounds that target other cellular pathways are effective only in male mice—indicating mutually exclusive sex-specific pathways. Therefore, a combination of interventions that target non-overlapping aging-related pathways appears to be an effective approach to further extend healthy lifespan in both sexes. Here, we review the germline and postnatal mouse lines that target the GH/IGF-1 axis as a mechanism to extend longevity as well as the dietary compounds that tested positive in the NIA program to increase lifespan.

Methods - We have screened the MECP2 gene coding region for mutations in five familial cases of Rett syndrome and studied the patterns of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in each girl. Results - We found a mutation in MECP2 in only one family. In the four families without mutation in MECP2, we found that (1) all mothers exhibit a totally skewed pattern of XCI; (2) six out of eight affected girls also have a totally skewed pattern of XCI; and (3) it is the paternally inherited X chromosome which is active in the patients with a skewed pattern of XCI. Given that the skewing of XCI is inherited in our families, we genotyped the whole X chromosome using 32 polymorphic markers and we show that a locus potentially responsible for the skewed XCI in these families could be located on the short arm of the X chromosome.

However, if both X-chromosome linked color deficient males (∼8%) and females (<1%) as well as heterozygote female carriers (∼15%) are excluded from comparisons, then differences between men and women in red-green (RG) color discrimination have been reported as not being significant (e.g., Pickford, 1944; Hood et al., 2006). We re-examined this question by assessing the performance of 150 males and 150 females on the color assessment and diagnosis (CAD) test (Rodriguez-Carmona et al., 2005). This is a sensitive test that yields small color detection thresholds. The test employs direction-specific, moving, chromatic stimuli embedded in a background of random, dynamic, luminance contrast noise. A four-alternative, forced-choice procedure is employed to measure the subject's thresholds for detection of color signals in 16 directions in color space, while ensuring that the subject cannot make use of any residual luminance contrast signals. In addition, we measured the Rayleigh anomaloscope matches in a subgroup of 111 males and 114 females. All the age-matched males (30.8 ± 9.7) and females (26.7 ± 8.8) had normal color vision as diagnosed by a battery of conventional color vision tests. Females with known color deficient relatives were excluded from the study. Comparisons between the male and female groups revealed no significant differences in anomaloscope midpoints (p = 0.709), but a significant difference in matching ranges (p = 0.040); females on average tended to have a larger mean range (4.11) than males (3.75). Females also had significantly higher CAD thresholds than males along the RG (p = 0.0004), but not along the yellow-blue (YB) discrimination axis. The differences between males and females in RG discrimination may be related to the heterozygosity in X-linked cone photo pigment expression common among females.

We have developed a family-based association test for quantitative traits, named XQTL, which uses X-linked markers in a nuclear family design. XQTL adopts the framework of the orthogonal model implemented in the QTDT program, modifying the sex-specific score for X-linked genotypes. XQTL also takes into account the dosage effect due to female X chromosome inactivation.

Fixed effects, derived from the phenotypic differences among and within families, are estimated by the least-squares method. Our proposed XQTL can perform allelic and two-locus haplotypic association tests and can provide estimates of additive genetic effects and variance components.

Besides hormones, several factors related to chromosome X have been called in action to explain this sex predominance. Areas covered This paper provides an overview on the role of chromosome X (chrX) in explaining why females have higher susceptibility to autoimmunity. The work outlines some essential concepts regarding chrX inactivation, escape from chrX inactivation and the evolutionary history of chrX. In addition, we will discuss the concept of gene escape in immune cells, with examples related to specific X-linked genes and autoimmune diseases. Expert opinion There is growing evidence that many genes present on chrX escape inactivation, and some of them have significant immune-mediated functions. In immune cells of female individuals the escape of these genes is not constant, but the knowledge of the mechanisms controlling this plasticity are not completely understood. Future studies aimed at the characterization of these modifications at single-cell resolution, together with conformational 3D studies of the inactive X chromosome, will hopefully help to fill this gap of knowledge.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 0 Total Times Cited: 0 Cited Reference Count: 100,10.1080/1744666x.2022.2060203,Autoimmune diseases;autoimmunity;escape from X-chromosome inactivation;mammalian evolution;sex bias;sex chromosomes;X-chromosome inactivation;CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;FEMALE PREDOMINANCE;SEX-DIFFERENCES;T-CELLS;DISEASE;GENDER;WOMEN;EPIDEMIOLOGY;MECHANISMS;MONOSOMY,,

The sex difference arises through the androgenic sparing of the motoneurons and their target muscles from ontogenetic cell death. Indirect evidence suggests that androgen acts on the target muscles rather than directly on SNB motoneurons to spare them from death. The testicular feminization mutation (Tfm), a defect in the androgen receptor (AR), blocks androgenic sparing of SNB motoneurons and their targets. The pattern of AR immunocytochemistry was previously found to be different in adult Tfm and wild-type rats: immunostaining was nuclear in most SNB cells of wild-type rats, but very few SNB cells display nuclear AR immunostaining in affected Tfm rats. Because the Tfm mutation is carried on the X chromosome, random X inactivation during development makes female carriers of Tfm (+/Ttm) genetic mosaics for androgen sensitivity. Tfm carriers, their wild-type sisters, and affected Tfm males were treated with perinatal testosterone and immunocytochemistry was used to detect androgen receptor in the SNB when the rats reached adulthood. Mosaic females could be distinguished from their wild-type sisters by external morphology. In such perinatally androgenized mosaics, adult SNB cells were equally divided between wild-type and Tfm genotype, as indicated by AR immunocytochemistry. In contrast, the pattern of AR immunocytochemistry in target muscles of mosaics appeared similar to that of wild-type females. These results indicate that early androgen spared both androgen-sensitive and -insensitive motoneurons from cell death, confirming a site of androgen action other than the motoneurons themselves.",L27148176 1997-05-11,10.1006/hbeh.1996.0047,androgen receptor;testosterone;animal experiment;apoptosis;article;controlled study;drug effect;female;lumbar spine;male;masculinization;motoneuron nucleus;mutant;nonhuman;phenotype;priority journal;rat;sex differentiation;subcutaneous drug administration;Apoptosis;Rats;Androgens;Virilism,,

Although recent studies have evaluated the differences in the clinical features and prognosis between the two sexes, many issues remain to be elucidated. At present, the only sex-specific condition that affects females is peripartum cardiomyopathy. Recent evidence suggests a pathogenetic role of a prolactin derivative, and ongoing clinical trials are investigating the possibility of targeted therapies using prolactin secretion inhibitors, such as bromocriptine and carbegoline. Although women were considered so far only carriers of X-linked diseases (Anderson-Fabry disease, Danon disease, Hunter syndrome and dystrophinopathies), clinical experience showed a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in females due to random X chromosome inactivation. Conversely, in mitochondrial diseases (with matrilineal inheritance), cardiomyopathies may occur in the context of clinical multisystemic involvement without significant gender-related differences. Autosomal inherited cardiomyopathies also show different phenotypes and prognostic impact according to gender. The hypothesis of a premenopausal protective role of female hormones towards myocardial involvement has been raised by recent data on transtiretin-related amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Preexisting cardiomyopathies may affect pregnancy, labor and delivery in women, since all these conditions are associated with important hemodynamic changes. Women with low-risk hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (asymptomatic and without left ventricular outflow tract gradient) usually can tolerate pregnancy. Conversely, women who are symptomatic before pregnancy or have severe hypertrophy with important outflow tract gradient are at higher risk and should be referred to a tertiary center to be evaluated on a case by case basis. Pregnancy in women with dilated cardiomyopathy and significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction represents a high-risk condition. In addition, information on the clinical course and potential complications in pregnant women with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy or restrictive cardiomyopathy is limited to individual reports. © 2012 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore.",L365401246 2012-08-16 2012-08-21,10.1714/1073.11761,bromocriptine;cabergoline;transthyretin;prolactin derivative;amyloidosis;autosomal inheritance;cardiomyopathy;Danon disease;obstetric delivery;disorders of mitochondrial functions;dystrophinopathy;Fabry disease;female;heart left ventricle outflow tract;heart right ventricle dysplasia;human;Hunter syndrome;hypertrophic cardiomyopathy;labor;left ventricular systolic dysfunction;peripartum cardiomyopathy;phenotype;pregnancy;pregnant woman;premenopause;prognosis;restrictive cardiomyopathy;review;sex difference;X chromosome inactivation;Cardiomyopathies,,

Findings: A total of 142 prepubertal children, 66 girls and 76 boys, suffering from severe sepsis and admitted to the PICU were included. The survival rate demonstrated a tendency to be higher in females (P = 0.14).

This report describes the results from factor VIII gene (F8) analysis of a New Zealand cohort of 45 proband HA patients. We screened all proband HA patients attending local clinics to determine the molecular basis of disease in each case. We also aimed to evaluate the significance of founder effect in this population and to explain an unusual case of HA in a female patient. HA patients were screened for the common F8 gene inversion mutations using previously described PCR-based techniques, and for single base substitution mutations using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and DNA sequencing. Analysis of microsatellite markers located within or near F8 was used to determine identity by descent and trace inheritance patterns of disease alleles. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) patterns were detected using methylation specific PCR. Pathogenic F8 gene mutations were detected in all 45 HA patients in this cohort and non-random XCI was confirmed in a female haemophiliac. We report nine novel F8 mutations, including two splicing mutations, a five nucleotide deletion and a large deletion at the 5′ end of the gene. The molecular aetiology of HA was similar to that described in other studies but the distribution of mutations was unusual due to founder effects, with almost a quarter of all probands being descended from just three individuals. © 2007 The Authors Journal compliation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",L47040173 2007-07-01,10.1111/j.1365-2516.2007.01487.x,blood clotting factor 8;nucleic acid;5' untranslated region;amino acid substitution;article;chromosome band;chromosome inactivation;chromosome inversion;clinical article;cohort analysis;controlled study;denaturing high performance liquid chromatography;DNA sequence;female;founder effect;gene location;gene mutation;genetic analysis;genetic screening;hemophilia A;human;inheritance;male;microsatellite marker;New Zealand;nucleic acid base substitution;nucleotide sequence;polymerase chain reaction;priority journal;sex difference;X chromosome;Hemophilia A;Hemophilia B,,

A fascinating aspect of evolution is the differentiation of sex chromosomes. Organisms with highly differentiated sex chromosomes, such as the mammalian X and Y, must compensate for the imbalance in gene dosage that this creates. The need to adjust the expression of sex-linked genes is a potent force driving the rise of regulatory mechanisms that act on an entire chromosome. This review will contrast the process of dosage compensation in Drosophila with the divergent strategies adopted by other model organisms. While the machinery of sex chromosome compensation is different in each instance, all share the ability to direct chromatin modifications to an entire chromosome. This review will also explore the idea that chromosome-targeting systems are sometimes adapted for other purposes.

Here, we examine the role of higher order chromatin structure across the 100-kb region of the mouse X-inactivation center (Xic) and map domains of specialized chromatin in vivo. By hypersensitive site mapping and chromosome conformation capture (3C), we identify two domains of higher order chromatin structure. Xite makes looping interactions with Tsix, while Xist makes contacts with Jpx/Enox, another non-coding gene not previously implicated in XCI. These regions interact in a developmentally-specific and sex-specific manner that is consistent with a regulatory role in XCI.

The vast base of information concerning normal and abnormal human sexual development that has accumulated since the advent of human cytogenetics 3 decades ago can be integrated by the following hypothesis: Homologous gonad-differentiation loci (GDLs) exist on the X and Y. The GDLs are strictly sex-linked; that is, normally they do not recombine during spermatogenesis, so that considerable divergence in DNA sequence doubtless has occurred between the locus on the X and the locus on the Y. The abundance of their evolutionarily conserved product - a substance still to be identified - determines the path of differentiation that the indifferent gonadal anlage of the early embryo will take: if only one GDL is transcribed, the case when two X chromosomes are present, ovary will develop; if two GDLs are transcribed, the case when a Y is present along with an X, testis will develop.

Previous studies have led to inconclusive evidence on the dynamics of local topological-associated domains (TADs) regarding their absence in the oocyte and appearance in the embryo versus preexistence in the zygote. To evaluate whether parental structures can be inherited in the newly formed embryo and how these structures may relate to gene regulation, preimplantation mouse models were used to map genomic interactions within each parental genome using single-cell high-throughput chromosome configuration capture. This protocol was carried out on highly polymorphic female hybrid embryos. Relative coverage of the two X chromosomes was assessed to investigate sex-specific differences between autosomes, and the presence of TAD-like domains was analyzed within clear boundaries of developmental stages. The results found that allelic domain organization fall into 3 major stages. The first category is parentally biased preformed domains (clusters 1-3) appearing as early as single-cell stage and mostly disappear by the 4-cell stage (other than cluster 2). The second category (clusters 4, 5) has a more transient bias, for 1 allele, and a weaker structure and a third category (clusters 6-9) are acquired de novo after embryonic genome activation. The parental-specific early domains of clusters 1 to 3 coincide with increasing trimethylation of H3 at Lys27 (H3K27me3). This epigenetic mark was most enriched in association with the maternal genome, and clusters 6 to 9 were depleted of it. Parentally preformed domains may form local compartments associated with the polycomb-repressive mark after fertilization that then disassemble into classic A and B compartments. Using previously published RNA-sequencing data, it was determined that parentally preformed domains have generally lower gene expression and a higher frequency of stronger biased genes. Maternally preformed domains encompassed 19 of 27 genes that had been previously reported as transiently maternally imprinted. Analysis of structural domain dynamics suggested that the loss of TAD structure on the paternal X chromosome occurs with or follows gene silencing, occurring at the 8-cell stage. The results of this study suggest that higher-order chromatin structure develops from parental-specific and early repressive compartments to the establishment of TADs in early development of the mouse. This developmental switch may explain the unusual chromatin landscape and nuclear organization of the early embryo compared with later stages. Preformed polycomb-marked repressive domains might be critical for counterbalancing genome activation for transiently imprinted genes affecting pluripotency programs and gene dose compensation in females (Xist). After embryonic gene activation, structures became TAD-like and associated with active chromatin states. The loss of TAD structure in paternal X-chromosome inactivation is a late event and the paternal X-chromosome progressively compacted by the blastocyst stage.",L633077687 2020-10-19 2020-12-15,10.1097/01.ogx.0000682172.27858.95,blastocyst;chromosome inactivation;chromosome structure;embryo development;epigenetics;gamete;gene activation;gene dosage;gene expression;gene frequency;gene silencing;human;nonhuman;note;preimplantation embryo;RNA sequence;sex difference;single cell analysis;single cell high throughput chromosome configuration capture;X chromosome;zygote,,

Methods: Genomic copy number was investigated for patients with unexplained mental retardation, and phenotypic features of the patients having interstitial duplications including MECP2 were analyzed. Results: Three male and one female patients with MECP2 duplication were identified. The phenotypic features of all the four patients were compatible with MECP2 duplication syndrome. The X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern was analyzed in the female patient, identifying a skewed XCI that activated the X-chromosome containing the MECP2 duplication.

V.",,,,,"The predominance of females segregating chromosome aberrations to their offspring has been explained mostly by selection disadvantage of unbalanced products of spermatogenesis. However, analysis of data from the literature supports the idea that somatic cells of early female embryos are similar to female germ cells in that they are prone to malsegregation. The goal of this study was to compare the sex ratio (male to female ratio) of carriers of presumably mitotic-occurring chromosome abnormalities to identify any sex biases. In examining the literature, we found a female prevalence in cases of mosaicism. associated with uniparental disomy (UPD) (26 male individuals/conceptions and 45 female individuals/conceptions, sex ratio is 0.58, significantly different from 1.06 in newborn population, P = 0.0292). This predominance was highest at gestational age < 16 week (8 male and 22 female conceptuses, sex ratio is 0.36, significantly different from expected figure of 1.28, P = 0.0025), which diminished at later stages of fetal development indicating potential correction of trisomies predominantly in females. There is a threefold prevalence of 46,XX/45,X mosaics over 46,XY/45,X mosaics in prenatally diagnosed cases, which also suggests a gender-specific post-zygotic chromosome loss. The male prevalence in Prader-Willi syndrome with maternal UPD of chromosome 15 also can be explained by sex-specific trisomy correction, with predominant loss of a maternal chromosome causing biparental inheritance and therefore, complete correction of trisomy in females (without UPD). Finally, there is a female predominance in carriers of chromosome rearrangement with pericentromere break (mosaicism. for Robertsonian translocation/iso-chromosome, centric fission, nonacrocentric isochromosome, and whole arm rearrangement), in both prenatal (21 mates and 36 females, sex ratio is 0.58, P < 0.0184) and postnatal ill-defined cases (14 males and 35 females, sex ratio is 0.40, P=0.001). Thus, the findings presented in this paper suggest that, in addition to reduction in male fertility, and to probable selection against abnormal cell line(s), there are two mechanisms that contribute to female preponderance among carriers of mosaicism: sex-specific chromosome loss and sex-specific centromere instability. The data obtained suggest that females may have gonadal mosaicism for aneuploidies and structural rearrangements more often than males. This may lead to the maternal origin bias in offspring with trisomies or structural rearrangements.

Xic action culminates in a change in Xist RNA property from a scarce, unstable RNA to highly expressed Xist RNA that coats the future inactive X. Deleting a 65-kb region downstream of Xist results in constitutive Xist expression and X inactivation, implying the presence of a cis-regulatory element. In this region, we now report the discovery of a gene antisense to Xist. Tsix is a 40-kb RNA originating 15 kb downstream of Xist and transcribed across the Xist locus. Tsix sequence is conserved at the human XIC. Tsix RNA has no conserved ORFs, is seen exclusively in the nucleus and is localized at Xic. Before the onset of X inactivation, Tsix is expressed from both X chromosomes. At the onset of X inactivation, Tsix expression becomes monoallelic, is associated with the future active X and persists until Xist is turned off. Tsix is not found on the inactive X once cells enter the X-inactivation pathway.

To further delineate the etiology of this association, we have evaluated XCI status in 207 women who experience RSA. A significant excess of trisomic losses was observed among the women who had RSA with skewed XCI versus those without skewed XCI (P=.02). There was also a significant excess of boys among live births in this group (P=.04), which is contrary to expectations if the cause of skewed XCI was only that these women carried X-linked lethal mutations. To confirm the association between skewed XCI and the risk of trisomy, an independent group of 53 women, ascertained on the basis of a prenatal diagnosis of trisomy mosaicism, were investigated. Only cases for which the trisomy was shown to be of maternal meiotic origin were included. The results show a significantly higher level of extreme skewing (> or = 90%) in women whose pregnancies involved placental trisomy mosaicism (17%) than in either of two separate control populations (n=102 and 99) (P=.02 compared with total control subjects). An additional 11 cases were ascertained on the basis of one or more trisomic-pregnancy losses. When all women in the present study with a trisomic pregnancy (n=103) were considered together, skewed XCI was identified in 18%, as compared with 7% in all controls (n=201) (P=.005). This difference was more pronounced when a cutoff of extreme skewing of 95% was used (10% vs. 1.5% skewed; P=.002). Maternal age was not associated with skewing in either the patient or control populations and therefore cannot account for the association with trisomy. Previous studies have shown that a reduced ovarian reserve is associated with increased risk of trisomic pregnancies.

An understanding of the factors that influence the yield of such mutations is important for management of adverse effects of perinatal exposures. Resistance to 6-thioguanine (6-TG) can be utilized to study mutational events at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) locus. HGPRT is X-linked and recessive. According to the Lyon hypothesis, male cells have only one X-chromosome and female cells randomly inactivate the second X-chromosome. This leads to the prediction that X-linked genes should be equally sensitive to the mutagenic effects of toxicants in male and female fetuses. METHODS: We tested this supposition by in utero exposure of Syrian hamster fetuses to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) at day 12 of gestation. ENU is a strong carcinogen and mutagen. HGPRT mutations were detected by selection with 6-TG. RESULTS: Surprisingly, the male cells had 4 to 5 times more 6-TG mutants than female cells, in two separate experiments (p<0.001). Ouabain resistance, reflecting a co-dominant autosomal locus, was used as a control, and we found that there was no significant difference between male and female cells (p = 0.549). CONCLUSIONS: Possible reasons for the sex difference in mutations include escape of the second X-chromosome from inactivation in some of the female cells, or higher mutability in male cells. In any event, there is a gender difference in vulnerability to mutation of an X-linked gene that has previously not been appreciated, and that may be relevant to toxicological studies of such genes.

Among the numerous biological factors that have been identified as increasing risk for antisocial behavior, one of the most well-supported has inexplicably received very little attention with regard to implications for explaining why maleness is such a robust predictor. That factor is the low activity form of the monoamine oxidase-A gene. A major reason for this inattention to the MAOA-L gene appears to be the failure to appreciate that its location on the X chromosome reflects the enormous biological disadvantage of the male compared to the female. This article, after presenting a brief overview of the research which establishes that MAOA-L is one of the most well-supported biological risk factors for antisocial behaviors, explained how the enormous male biological disadvantage related to the sex difference in the prevalence of MAOA-L and thus helped explain why maleness is the most robust predictor of antisocial behavior.

Curing cancer through precision medicine is the paramount aim of the new wave of molecular and genomic therapies. Currently, whether patients with non-reproductive cancers are male or female according to their sex chromosomes is not adequately considered in patient standard of care. This is a matter of consequence because there is growing evidence that these cancer types generally initiate earlier and are associated with higher overall incidence and rates of death in males compared with females. Gender, in contrast to sex, refers to a chosen sexual identity. Hazardous lifestyle choices (notably tobacco smoking) differ in prevalence between genders, aligned with disproportionate cancer risk. These add to underlying genetic predisposition and influences of sex steroid hormones. Together, these factors affect metabolism, immunity and inflammation, and ultimately the fidelity of the genetic code. To accurately understand how human defences against cancer erode, it is crucial to establish the influence of sex.

In the 6 daughters of these 3 males, there is little or no cytogenetic expression of the fra(X). I interpret these pedigrees within the context of my X-inactivation imprinting model of the fra(X) syndrome (Genetics 117:587-599): the cytogenetic manifestation of the imprinted state of the mutant fra(X) chromosome [high percentage of cytogenetic expression] is no longer present in daughters of imprinted males.

Although human life expectancy has increased each year, females still live longer, on average, than males. Undoubtedly, the reasons for the sex gap in life expectancy are multifaceted, and it has been discussed from both sociological and biological perspectives. However, even if biological factors make up only a small percentage of the determinants of the sex difference in this phenomenon, parity in average life expectancy should not be anticipated. Objective: The aim of this review is to highlight biological mechanisms that may underlie the sexual dimorphism in life expectancy. Methods: Using PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar, as well as cited and citing reference histories of articles through August 2012, English-language articles were identified, read, and synthesized into categories that could account for biological sex differences in human life expectancy. Results: The examination of biological mechanisms accounting for the female-based advantage in human life expectancy has been an active area of inquiry; however, it is still difficult to prove the relative importance of any 1 factor. Nonetheless, biological differences between the sexes do exist and include differences in genetic and physiological factors such as progressive skewing of X chromosome inactivation, telomere attrition, mitochondrial inheritance, hormonal and cellular responses to stress, immune function, and metabolic substrate handling among others. These factors may account for at least a part of the female advantage in human life expectancy. Conclusions: Despite noted gaps in sex equality, higher body fat percentages and lower physical activity levels globally at all ages, a sex-based gap in life expectancy exists in nearly every country for which data exist. There are several biological mechanisms that may contribute to explaining why females live longer than men on average, but the complexity of the human life experience makes research examining the contribution of any single factor for the female advantage difficult. However, this information may still prove important to the development of strategies for healthy aging in both sexes. © 2012 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.",L366192703 2012-12-12 2012-12-19,10.1016/j.genm.2012.10.001,estrogen;lipoprotein;sex hormone;article;body fat;cell stress;conception;disease association;extrachromosomal inheritance;female;heredity;human;hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system;immunity;language;life expectancy;lipid metabolism;lipoprotein metabolism;male;Medline;mental stress;oxidative stress;personal experience;physical activity;priority journal;sex difference;telomere;X chromosome inactivation;Life Expectancy,,

We examined X-inactivation ratios (fraction of cells with the same X chromosome active) in two sets of peripheral blood DNA samples collected about two decades apart. We observed a strong correlation between the ratios of individual females at the two time points and found no significant difference between the two sets of measurements. These observations indicate that aging, per se (as opposed to being "" aged""), has little effect on X-inactivation. However, we also found that several females who were older than 60 years of age at the time of the first measurement acquired significant changes in the X-inactivation ratio. We speculate that, if X-inactivation skewing is a frequently acquired trait in older females, it is acquired as the result of a discontinuous or catastrophic process and is not the result of constant selection for or against hematopoietic stem cells with a particular X chromosome active. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",L39341712 2004-10-20,10.1007/s00439-004-1177-8,adenine;androgen receptor;cytosine;DNA;guanine;adult;age;aging;article;chromosome analysis;controlled study;correlation analysis;DNA determination;female;genetic selection;genetic trait;hematopoietic stem cell;heterozygosity;human;human cell;human experiment;longitudinal study;normal human;observation;population research;priority journal;sex difference;time;trinucleotide repeat;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Longitudinal Studies,,

In women there is no substantive evidence to suggest that SLE reduces fertility, but subfertility may occur as a result of active disease, immunosuppressive drugs, and age-related declines in fertility related to delays in childbearing. Although pregnancy outcomes have improved, SLE still poses risks in pregnancy that contribute to poorer maternal and fetal outcomes. Cyclophosphamide, an important agent for the treatment of severe or life-threatening lupus, may adversely affect fertility, particularly with increases in dose and patient age. Fertility preservation techniques are therefore an important consideration for women and men before cytotoxic treatment. There is mixed evidence as to whether exogenous estrogen in the form of oral contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy may increase the risk for the development of SLE, but among women with SLE already diagnosed, combined oral contraceptive pills and hormone replacement therapy do not confer risk for severe flare and remain important in reproductive care. The higher incidence of SLE in women may nonetheless be attributable to effects of endogenous estrogen, as well as failures in X chromosome inactivation, increased Toll-like receptor gene products, and changes in microRNA function.

XCI results in silencing of transcription from one ChrX homolog per female cell. However, approximately 25% of human ChrX genes escape XCI to some extent and exhibit biallelic expression in females. The evolutionary basis of this phenomenon is not entirely clear, but high sequence conservation of XCI escapers suggests that purifying selection may directly or indirectly drive XCI escape at these loci. One hypothesis is that this signal results from contributions to developmental and physiological sex differences, but presently there is limited evidence supporting this model in humans. Another potential driver of this signal is selection for high and/or broad gene expression in both sexes, which are strong predictors of reduced nucleotide substitution rates in mammalian genes. Here, we compared purifying selection and gene expression patterns of human XCI escapers with those of X-inactivated genes in both sexes. When we accounted for the functional status of each ChrX gene's Y-linked homolog (or ""gametolog""), we observed that XCI escapers exhibit greater degrees of purifying selection in the human lineage than X-inactivated genes, as well as higher and broader gene expression than X-inactivated genes across tissues in both sexes.

Similar to humans, female mice exhibit far lower incidences of angiotensin II-induced AAAs than males. In addition to sex hormones, the X and Y sex chromosomes, and their unique complements of genes, may contribute to sexually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of female (XX) versus male (XY) sex chromosome complement on angiotensin II-induced AAA formation and rupture in phenotypically female mice. Methods: Female low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) deficient mice with an XX or XY sex chromosome complement were infused with angiotensin II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic males, female mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as adults before angiotensin II infusions. Results: Female Ldlr -/- deficient mice with an XX and XY sex chromosome complement had similar sex organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from female XY mice selectively expressed Y chromosome genes, whereas genes known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX females. The majority of aortic gene differences in XY versus XX females fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY females. AAAs from XY females exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY females. Moreover, aortas from XY females had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX adult females. Conclusions: An XY sex chromosome complement in phenotypic females profoundly influenced aortic gene expression profiles and promoted AAA severity. When XY females were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY females include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that genes on the sex chromosomes regulate aortic vascular biology and contribute to sexual dimorphism of AAAs. Sex chromosome genes may serve as novel targets for sex-specific AAA therapeutics.",L613690003 2016-12-19 2017-02-09,10.1161/circulationaha.116.023789,"angiotensin I;angiotensin II;gelatinase A;interleukin 1beta;lipopolysaccharide;low density lipoprotein receptor;testosterone;abdominal aorta;adult;angiotensin ii induced abdominal aortic aneurysm;animal experiment;animal model;article;atherosclerosis;blood pressure measurement;bone marrow cell;bone marrow derived macrophage;cell isolation;DNA microarray;echography;enzymatic assay;ex vivo study;experimental disease;explant;female;gene expression;gonadectomy;karyotype 46,XX;karyotype 46,XY;male;morbidity;mouse;newborn;nonhuman;organ weight;oxidative stress;phenotype;plasma renin activity;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis;polymerase chain reaction;priority journal;radioimmunoassay;RNA extraction;sex difference;testosterone blood level;zymography;Mice;Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal;Sex Chromosomes;Aortic Aneurysm",,

These differences in their genomes cause sex differences in the functions of cells, both in the gonads and in non-gonadal tissues. This review discusses mouse models that have shed light on these direct genetic effects of sex chromosomes that cause sex differences in physiology. Because many sex differences in tissues are caused by different effects of male and female gonadal hormones, it is important to attempt to discriminate between direct genetic and hormonal effects. Numerous mouse models exist in which the number of X or Y genes is manipulated, aiming to observe the effects on phenotype. In two models, namely the four core genotypes model and SF1 knockout gonadless mice, it is possible to detect sex chromosome effects that are not explained by group differences in gonadal hormones.

However, XX and XY cells are intrinsically different because of the cell-autonomous sex-biasing action of X and Y genes. Results: Recent studies of mice, in which sex chromosome complement is independent of gonadal sex, reveal that sex chromosome complement has strong effects contributing to sex differences in phenotypes such as metabolism. Adult mice with two X chromosomes (relative to mice with one X chromosome) show dramatically greater increases in body weight and adiposity after gonadectomy, irrespective of their gonadal sex. When fed a high-fat diet, XX mice develop striking hyperinsulinemia and fatty liver, relative to XY mice. The sex chromosome effects are modulated by the presence of gonadal hormones, indicating an interaction of the sex-biasing effects of gonadal hormones and sex chromosome genes. Conclusions: Other cell-autonomous sex chromosome effects are detected in mice in many phenotypes. Birds (relative to eutherian mammals) are expected to show more widespread cell-autonomous sex determination in non-gonadal tissues, because of ineffective sex chromosome dosage compensation mechanisms.

In marsupials and the extra-embryonic region of the mouse, however, X inactivation is imprinted: the paternal X chromosome is preferentially inactivated whereas the maternal X is always active. Having more than one active X chromosome is deleterious to extra-embryonic development in the mouse. Here we show that the gene eed (embryonic ectoderm development), a member of the mouse Polycomb group (Pc-G) of genes, is required for primary and secondary trophoblast giant cell development in female embryos. Results from mice carrying a paternally inherited X-linked green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene implicate eed in the stable maintenance of imprinted X inactivation in extra-embryonic tissues.

Because alternative splice variants of IRAK1 are also produced in the region surrounding the critical single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs1059703), we also tested the abundance of alternative splice variant IRAK1 transcripts.

By contrast, the expression levels of IRAK1-A, B, and C were not affected by the variant IRAK1 haplotype in either sex. Allele-specific primers generated WT and variant-IRAK1 amplicons with high selectivity, and on average produced about half the expression levels of each transcript in heterozygous IRAK1-mosaic females. Because injury was shown to induce de novo ChrX skewing of WBCs, we tested the directional XCI ratio changes in WBC in a sample of trauma patients heterozygous for the variant IRAK1 haplotype (n = 18). Using the allele-specific assay in combination with the DNA methylation status at the polymorphic HUMARA locus, we found that at admission, about 60% the patients presented XCI ratios skewed toward WBCs with active ChrXs carrying the variant-IRAK1 similar to healthy controls.

The complex mechanisms that regulate the X chromosome lead to evolutionary and physiological variability in gene expression between species, the sexes, individuals, developmental stages, tissues and cell types. In early development, delayed and incomplete X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in some species causes variability in gene expression. Additional diversity stems from escape from XCI and from mosaicism or XCI skewing in females.

The ratio between male and female PGD-derived cell lines was compared. We found a significant increase in female cell lines (76%). This finding was further confirmed by a meta-analysis for combining the results of all PGD-derived HESC lines published to date (148) and all normal karyotyped HESC lines derived from spare in vitro fertilization embryos worldwide (397). Further, gender determination of embryos demonstrated that this difference originates from the actual derivation process rather than from unequal representation of male and female embryos. It can therefore be concluded that the clear-cut tendency for female preponderance is attributed to suboptimal culture conditions rather than from a true gender imbalance in embryos used for derivation of HESC lines.

X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) occurs during development, coupled with cell differentiation. In somatic cells, XCI is random, whereas in extraembryonic tissues, XCI is imprinted in that the paternally inherited X chromosome is preferentially inactivated. Inactivation is initiated from an X-linked locus, the X-inactivation center (Xic), and inactivity spreads along the chromosome toward both ends. XCI is established by complex mechanisms, including DNA methylation, heterochromatinization, and late replication. Once established, inactivity is stably maintained in subsequent cell generations. The function of an X-linked regulatory gene, Xist, is critically involved in XCI. The Xist gene maps to the Xic, it is transcribed only from the inactive X chromosome, and the Xist RNA associates with the inactive X chromosome in the nucleus. Investigations with Xist-containing transgenes and with deletions of the Xist gene have shown that the Xist gene is required in cis for XCI. Regulation of XCI is therefore accomplished through regulation of Xist. Transcription of the Xist gene is itself regulated by DNA methylation. Hence, the differential methylation of the Xist gene observed in sperm and eggs and its recognition by protein binding constitute the most likely mechanism regulating imprinted preferential expression of the paternal allele in preimplantation embryos and imprinted paternal XCI in extraembryonic tissues. This article reviews the mechanisms underlying XCI and recent advances elucidating the functions of the Xist gene in mice and humans.","1098-5557 Goto, T Monk, M Journal Article Review United States 1998/06/10 Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 1998 Jun;62(2):362-78. doi: 10.1128/MMBR.62.2.362-378.1998.",10.1128/mmbr.62.2.362-378.1998,"Animals;DNA Methylation;DNA Replication/genetics/physiology;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Female;Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics;*Genomic Imprinting;Heterochromatin/genetics;Humans;Male;Mice;Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics/physiology;Sex Factors;Humanities;Humanism;X Chromosome",,

A generalization of this 'protected invasion' theory also predicts that parental and alloparental care will tend to be associated with the homogametic sex in diploid populations if the Y chromosome of the heterogametic sex is absent or largely inert. Sex differences in (allo)parental care (i.e. either parental or alloparental care) should increase with increased asymmetry between the sexes in the fraction of behaviour-influencing loci occurring on their characteristic sex chromosomes. The theory explains the strong predisposition towards female (allo)parental care in mammals, a contrasting tendency towards male (allo)parental care in birds, the propensity for joint male and female (allo)parental care in termites, and biases towards female cooperation in social spiders. The theory also explains the apparent rarity or absence of alloparental care in marsupials, an intriguing consequence of preferential paternal X-chromosome inactivation in this taxon. Thus protected invasion theory possibly provides new insights into the relationship between social structure and the generic system.

We discuss possible mechanisms for sex specific differences including gender differences in immune response and organ vulnerability, reproductive capacity including pregnancy, sex hormones, genetic predisposition, parental inheritance, and epigenetics.

This chapter focuses on events downstream from the spread of XIST RNA across the interphase chromosome, to consider how this large noncoding RNA interacts with and silences a whole chromosome. Several lines of evidence are summarized that point to the involvement of repeat sequences in different aspects of the X-inactivation process. Although the ""repeat genome"" comprises close to half of the human genome, the potential for abundant repeats to contribute to genome regulation has been largely overlooked and may be underestimated. X inactivation has the potential to reveal roles of interspersed and other repeats in the genome. For example, evidence indicates that XIST RNA acts at the architectural level of the whole chromosome to induce formation of a silent core enriched for nongenic and repetitive (Cot-1) DNA, which corresponds to the DAPI-dense Barr body. Expression of repeat RNAs may contribute to chromosome remodeling, and evidence suggests that other types of repeat elements may be involved in escape from X inactivation. Despite great progress in decoding the rest of the genome, we suggest that the repeat genome may contain meaningful but complex language that remains to be better studied and understood. © 2010 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",L362489877 2011-09-13 2011-09-20,10.1101/sqb.2010.75.030,aurkb protein;BRCA1 protein;cot 1 rna;dinucleotide;DNA;heterochromatin protein 1;RNA;scaffold protein;unclassified drug;untranslated RNA;xist RNA;article;binding affinity;chromosome structure;embryo tissue;gene control;gene expression;gene silencing;genetic transcription;genome;heterochromatin;histone ubiquitination;human;inner cell mass;interphase;mammal cell;metaphase;mitosis;mitosis spindle;nonhuman;nucleotide repeat;priority journal;prophase;protein analysis;protein RNA binding;regulatory mechanism;sex difference;somatic cell;tandem repeat;tumor suppressor gene;X chromatin;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome;Genomics;Genome,,

Here, we have analyzed this sex dependence in more detail. Our results show that differences between male and female placental weights are characteristic of interspecific matings and are not observed in intraspecific Mus musculus matings. The effect is retained in congenic lines that contain differing lengths of M. spretus-derived X chromosome.

V.",,,,,"Research has established the broad mammalian developmental plan that genes on the sex chromosomes influence gonad development which determines gonadal hormone production (or its absence) leading to modification of the genitalia and simultaneously biasing the nervous system to organize adult sexual behavior. This might be considered the ''gonad to hormones to behavior'' model. It is clear, however, that although this model generally works well it is incomplete. The model does not account for behavioral influences attributed to the environment or to genetic but nongonadal or hormonal factors. In this essay we probe those areas of sexual development that are neither differentiated by hormones nor activated by them. The concept of the environment used for our discussion is very broad; it incorporates considerations of both the molar and the molecular levels. The general sense of the word ''environment'' as something exterior to the person is retained, even if that something influences intraperson processes. In addition, we focus directly on molecular events themselves. Here the ''environment'' involved can be that within a DNA segment. We also expand the notion of ''biologically based sex differences.'' Although many, and perhaps most, important sex differences arise from gonadal and hormonal development, also important are sex differences which are neither gonadal nor hormonal. All these factors affect the internal workings of the individual and intervene in structuring how the social environment might or might not modify sexual behavior.

This poor progress has been due to the paucity of available genetic markers. Whereas the X chromosome is known to include at least 100 functional genetic loci, only three or four loci have been ascribed to the Y chromosome and even the existence of several of these loci is controversial. Other factors limiting genetic analysis are the small size of the Y chromosome, which makes cytogenetic definition difficult, and the absence of extensive recombination. Based on cytogenetic observation and speculation, a working model of the Y chromosome has been proposed. In this classical model the Y chromosome is defined into subregions; an X-Y homologous meiotic pairing region encompassing most of the Y chromosome short arm and, perhaps, including a pseudoautosomal region of sex chromosome exchange; a pericentric region containing the sex determining gene or genes; and a long arm heterochromatic genetically inert region. The classical model has been supported by studies on the MIC2 loci, which encode a cell surface antigen defined by the monoclonal antibody 12E7. The X linked locus MIC2X, which escapes X inactivation, maps to the tip of the X chromosome short arm and the homologous locus MIC2Y maps to the Y chromosome short arm; in both cases, these loci are within the proposed meiotic pairing region. MIC2Y is the first biochemically defined, expressed locus to be found on the human Y chromosome. The proposed simplificity of the classical model has been challenged by recent molecular analysis of the Y chromosome. Using cloned probes, several groups have shown that a major part of the Y chromosome short arm is unlikely to be homologous to the X chromosome short arm. A substantial block of sequences of the short arm are homologous to sequences of the X chromosome long arm but well outside the pairing region. In addition, the short arm contains sequences shared with the Y chromosome long arm and sequences shared with autosomes. About two-thirds of XX males contain detectable Y derived sequences. As the amount of Y sequences present varies in different XX males, DNA from these subjects can be used to construct a map of the region around the sex determining gene. Assuming that XX males are usually caused by simple translocation, the sex determining genes cannot be located in the pericentric region. Although conventional genetic analysis of the Y chromosome is difficult, this chromosome is particularly suited to molecular analysis. Paradoxically, the Y chromosome may soon become the best defined human chromosome at the molecular level and may become the model for other chromosomes.",L15227845 1985-11-28,10.1136/jmg.22.5.329,chromosome pairing;gene locus;genetic analysis;heredity;histology;human;human cell;meiosis;molecular genetics;normal human;normal value;priority journal;sex determination;sex difference;Y chromosome;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

One is equine embryo sexing by either non-invasive biotechnological methods, such as monitoring of X-linked enzymes before X chromosome inactivation and detection of sex-specific antigen, or by invasive biotechnological methods, such as cytogenetic analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The other one is equine foetus sexing using ultrasound scanning in different stages of its development (early, mid or late), by different approaches (transrectally or transabdominally).

It also occurs more commonly in older female populations. To understand the etiology of non-random XCI and utilize this assay appropriately in clinical research and practice, the age-related alteration in XCI patterns in normal females needs to be clearly defined. In the present study, we evaluated the XCI status in 350 unselected women aged 0-88 years with unknown history of genetic disorders or abnormal pregnancies. DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood and analyzed by a methylation-based assay at the androgen receptor locus. A weak but significant positive correlation was observed between age and degree of skewing in XCI over the whole age range (r = 0.23, p < 0.0001), and skewing values become non-normally distributed at older ages. However, the increase in skewed XCI appears to be more pronounced after age 30 than at younger ages. This trend supports the model of increased skewing with age as a consequence of hematopoietic stem cell senescence. An alternative possibility is that there is allele-specific loss of methylation with time that results in the appearance of increased XCI skewing using a methylation-based assay.

The rationale of these techniques in relation to the functional aspect of the X chromosome is that the inactive X chromosome would show asynchrony in DNA synthesis, show differential fluorescence, respond differentially to in vivo 5-BrdU treatment and the active X chromosome would show aberrations when treated with 3H-Uridine. From the results, it appears that the X chromosomes in both male (XO) and female (XX) somatic cells of Acheta are euchromatic (active). Further, the single X in the male is transcriptionally as active as the two X chromosomes in the female. In other words, the single X in the male is hyperactive when compared with the single X in the female. From this it is inferred that the male X chromosome is differentially regulated in order to bring about an equalization of its gene product(s) to that produced by both Xs in the female. Drosophila melanogaster has a comparable system of dosage compensation. Thus, Acheta is yet another insect showing evidence for an X chromosome regulatory mechanism of dosage compensation.

Neuroradiologic findings in affected children report a smaller corpus callosum, but this finding has not been quantified. This is in part due to the large intersubject variability of the corpus callosum size and shape and the small number of subjects with 18q-, which leads to low statistical power for comparison with typically developing children. An analysis method called targetless spatial normalization (TSN) was used to improve the sensitivity of statistical testing. TSN converges all images in a group into what is referred as group common space. The group common space conserves common shape, size, and orientation while reducing intragroup variability. TSN in conjunction with a Witelson vertical partitioning scheme was used to assess differences in corpus callosum size between 12 children with 18q- and 12 age-matched normal controls. Significant global and regional differences in corpus callosum size were seen.

J. and Roff, D. A.",,,,,"Sexual dimorphism (SD) is a defining feature of gonochorous animals and dioecious plants, but the evolution of SD from an initially monomorphic genome presents a conundrum. Theory predicts that the evolution of SD will be facilitated if genes with sex-specific fitness effects occur on sex chromosomes. We review this theory and show that it generates three testable predictions. For organisms with an XX/XY chromosomal system of sex determination: (1) SD should be associated with X-linked effects; (2) X-linked effects should show strong directional dominance for sexually dimorphic traits favored in males but expressed in both sexes; and (3) SD should be associated with a reduction in the between-sex additive genetic covariance and correlation. A literature review reveals that empirical evaluations of the association between sex-linkage and SD have lagged behind theory. Tests for the presence of sex-linked effects have been plagued by the need to make simplifying assumptions, such as the absence of dominance or maternal effects, that greatly weaken their discriminatory power. Further, most have used comparisons between species or populations, whereas the correct level of analysis is within populations. To overcome these problems, we derive a novel pedigree design that permits separate estimation of X-linked, dominance and maternal effects. We suggest that the data from such a design would be most appropriately analyzed using the animal model. This novel protocol will allow quantitative evaluation of the above predictions, and hence should spur progress in understanding the role of sex-linkage in the evolution of SD.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 103 Total Times Cited: 107 Cited Reference Count: 89,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800895,sexual dimorphism;sex-linkage;diallel cross;animal model;DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER;SIZE DIMORPHISM;BODY-SIZE;CORRELATED RESPONSE;X-INACTIVATION;EVOLUTION;CHROMOSOMES;SELECTION;FITNESS;TRAITS,,

F. and Lachman, H. M.",,,,,"The absence of father-to-son transmission has been observed in a subset of families with bipolar disorder (BPD), suggestive of a susceptibility gene on the sex-linked portion of the X chromosome. This is supported by some genetic linkage studies that have provided evidence for a susceptibility locus near Xq28. We have analyzed one candidate gene on Xq28, SYBL1, which maps to the Xq pseudoautosomal region (PAR). SYBL1 encodes a member of the synaptobrevin family of proteins that is involved in synaptic vesicle docking and membrane transport. Genes in the PAR generally escape X-chromosome inactivation and have an active homolog on the Y chromosome, which would result in an increase in same-sex concordance in paternal transmitted traits. However, SYBL1 is neither expressed on the Y chromosome nor the inactive X chromosome and would therefore be expected to show typical sex-linked transmission. We have screened SYBL1 for mutations that could be tested as candidate alleles in the development of BPD. Following single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing, four single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected: a silent mutation at codon 108, two intron mutations without any obvious biological significance, and a G-->C transversion in the polypyrimidine tract at the 3' splice acceptor site preceding exon 8. This polymorphism, which creates a perfect 16/16 stretch of pyrimidines, was analyzed in 110 patients with BPD not selected for sex-linked transmission and 119 control subjects. The results show a statistical trend toward an increase in the frequency of the C allele in males with BPD but not females.

The complex is made up of multimers of three distinct subunits (E1, E2 and E3) and changes in the PDHA1 gene are responsible for the majority of cases of PDHC deficiency. The PDHA1 gene is on the X chromosome, however PDHC deficiency appears to affect males and females equally due to skewed X chromosome inactivation in the affected females. Sequence analyses of the PDHA1 gene were performed for over 600 patients with suspected PDHC deficiency and causative mutations were detected in 68 cases. We have identified 23 novel mutations from this cohort. Our objective is to look for genotypic and phenotypic relationships to determine if there are any gender differences. Methods and results: We sequenced the PDHA1 gene in over 600 patients with possible PDHC deficiency. We detected mutations in 14% of females (44/317) and 8% of males (24/291) tested. The genetics and clinical features of the positive cases were reviewed. The average age at the time of testing was 3.5 years for females and 5.9 years for males. We have clinical information on 44/68 (32 female and 12 male) patients with mutations. Most cases presented with neurological plus other system involvement. Seven of forty-four patients had only neurological symptoms all of whom were female. Nine of forty-four patients had abnormal PDHC activity (7/32 females and 2/12 males). The most common reason for testing was lactic acidosis (21/32 females and 10/12 males). Developmental delay was the most common neurological finding (19/32 females and 6/12 males). Microcephaly was recorded in 14/44 positive cases (12/32 female and 2/12 males). Sixteen of the forty-four patients had brain MRIs. Four patients had cortical atrophy (3 females and 1 male), 3 patients had brain malformations (all female), 2 patients had abnormalities seen in the basal ganglia (1 female and 1 male) and 3 patients had undisclosed MRI abnormalities (all female). An MRS lactate peak was recorded in 3 of the cases and all of these patients also had elevated serum lactate. Female patients tend to have more severe mutations (15/44 [14%] are null mutations) while males have milder mutations (2/24 [8%] are null mutations). Conclusions: A higher mutation detection rate was observed in females compared to males tested. Females tend to have more severe mutations than males probably because of null mutations are better tolerated due to X inactivation. In those patients where information is available, female patients tended to have more problems related to brain development in particular there was a higher rate of microcephaly and brain malformations in females in comparison to males.",L70732339 2012-05-07,10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.01.004,genetic heterogeneity;sex difference;society;metabolic disorder;mutation;female;patient;human;male;gene;microcephaly;X chromosome inactivation;brain malformation;atrophy;sequence analysis;diseases;pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency;lactic acidosis;brain;clinical feature;lactate blood level;genetics;basal ganglion;X chromosome;brain development;neurologic disease;nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;Mutation,,

In human males, however, only small regions of sequence identity exist between the sex chromosomes. Recombination and genetic exchange is restricted to these regions of identity, which cover 2.6 and 0.4 Mbp, respectively, and are located at the tips of the short and the long arm of the X and Y chromosome. The unique biology of these regions has attracted considerable interest, and complete long-range restriction maps as well as comprehensive physical maps of overlapping YAC clones are already available. A dense genetic linkage map has disclosed a high rate of recombination at the short arm telomere. A consequence of the obligatory recombination within the pseudoautosomal region is that genes show only partial sex linkage. Pseudoautosomal genes are also predicted to escape X-inactivation, thus guaranteeing an equal dosage of expressed sequences between the X and Y chromosomes. Gene pairs that are active on the X and Y chromosomes are suggested as candidates for the phenotypes seen in numerical X chromosome disorders, such as Klinefelter's (47,XXY) and Turner's syndrome (45,X).

Microglia, both in their capacity as phagocytic cells and via secretion of many neuroactive molecules, including cytokines and growth factors, play a central role in early brain development, including sexual differentiation of the brain. In this review, we present the vast roles microglia play in normal brain development and how perturbations in the normal neuroimmune environment during development may contribute to the etiology of brain-based disorders. There are notable differences between microglia and neuroimmune signaling in the male and female brain throughout the life span, and these differences may contribute to the vast differences in the incidence of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders between males and females.",L604697352 2015-06-09 2015-06-19,10.1177/1073858414536468,AMPA receptor;caspase 3;CD11b antigen;cyclic AMP;cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase;cyclooxygenase 1;cyclooxygenase 2;cytokine;estradiol;estrogen;estrogen receptor alpha;gamma interferon;growth factor;integrin;killer cell activating receptor associated protein;macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta;macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha;microRNA;phosphatidylserine;prostaglandin;prostaglandin E2;serotonin transporter;steroid;testis determining factor;testosterone;transforming growth factor beta;aggression;amygdala;androgen synthesis;antiinflammatory activity;anxiety disorder;apoptosis;Asperger syndrome;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;autism;autoimmune disease;bacterial infection;bipolar disorder;brain;brain development;brain region;cell proliferation;cell survival;cerebral palsy;cerebrovascular accident;chronic inflammation;cognition;dendritic spine;developmental disorder;disease predisposition;dyslexia;embryo development;environmental factor;female;femininity;gene expression regulation;genotype environment interaction;Gilles de la Tourette syndrome;gonad development;hematopoiesis;hippocampus;hormone action;human;incidence;innate immunity;interpersonal communication;learning disorder;long term depression;long term potentiation;major depression;male;masculinity;mast cell;mediator release;menopause;microglia;mood disorder;myeloid progenitor cell;nerve cell plasticity;nerve degeneration;nervous system development;nervous system inflammation;neuroimmunology;neurologic disease;neurotransmission;nonhuman;perinatal period;phagocytosis;posttraumatic stress disorder;preoptic area;priority journal;review;schizophrenia;sex determination;sex difference;sex differentiation;sexual behavior;social behavior;spinal cord injury;subventricular zone;synaptic transmission;synaptogenesis;testis development;traumatic brain injury;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;yolk sac;Brain;Sex Characteristics;Microglia,,

However, many individuals with these disorders are not diagnosed, despite established groups of core features that include aberrant brain development and function. Clinical presentations often include characteristic profiles of intellectual ability, motor impairments, and rates of neurological and psychiatric disorders that are higher than those of the general population. Advances in genetics and neuroimaging have substantially expanded knowledge of potential mechanisms that underlie these phenotypes, including a putative dose effect of sex chromosome genes on neuroanatomical structures and cognitive abilities. Continuing attention to emerging trends in research of sex chromosome aneuploidies is important for clinicians because it informs appropriate management of these common genetic disorders.

Whether desmoid tumor is a truly neoplastic cellular proliferative process or, alternatively, an unchecked reactive process has been a subject of debate. In order to determine whether desmoid tumor is composed of a clonal cell population as opposed to being a polyclonal reactive process, analysis of patterns of X-chromosome inactivation was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissues were microdissected to obtain both lesional and normal control samples, and the genomic DNAs were extracted by proteinase K digestion. Following treatment with methylation sensitive restriction endonuclease (Hha I or Hpa II), the genomic DNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using nested primers targeted to a highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) of the human androgen receptor (HUMARA). In eight of 12 cases, PCR amplification of the genomic DNAs was successful, and all eight of the amplified cases were heterozygous in the size of the HUMARA target. The remaining cases could not be studied because of failure to amplify DNA. Following digestion with HhaI or Hpa II, uniform patterns of X-chromosome inactivation were found in all eight desmoid tumors, whereas normal control tissue remained heterozygous. These results confirm a clonal composition of the tumors. The demonstration of clonality in the tumors in all eight informative cases indicates that desmoid tumor is a true neoplastic process, not an unchecked polyclonal reactive process.","Lucas, D R Shroyer, K R McCarthy, P J Markham, N E Fujita, M Enomoto, T E Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 1997/03/01 Am J Surg Pathol. 1997 Mar;21(3):306-11. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199703000-00006.",10.1097/00000478-199703000-00006,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Clone Cells;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Female;Fibroma/*genetics/pathology;Humans;Middle Aged;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Receptors, Androgen/*genetics;Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics;Retrospective Studies;Sex Factors;X Chromosome;Neoplasms",,

Lipopolysaccharide-mediated acute inflammation increased Xist levels in the cytoplasm of female mouse J774A.1 macrophages and human AML193 monocytes. In both cell types, cytoplasmic Xist colocalizes with the p65 subunit of NF-κB. This interaction was associated with reduced NF-κB nuclear migration, suggesting a novel mechanism to suppress acute inflammation. Further supporting this hypothesis, expression of 5′ XIST in male cells significantly reduced IL-6 and NF-κB activity. Adoptive transfer of male splenocytes expressing Xist reduced acute paw swelling in male mice indicating that Xist can have a protective anti-inflammatory effect.

They are used as standard treatments for hypertension, congestive cardiac failure and diabetes. Angioedema is an adverse effect associated the use of ACEi which is significantly more common in Black and Coloured South Africans than in the Caucasian population. This serious adverse effect is frequently life-threatening and fatal. The use of ACEi such as enalapril precipitates severe anaphylactic reactions which are induced by activation of bradykinin, a vasodilatory and pro-inflammatory nonapeptide. Angioedema may only be associated with the use of enalapril and not other classes of ACEi such as perindopril or ramipril. The incidence of ACEi associated angioedema (AEi) as a life-threatening adverse effect has been associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C2399A in the XPNPEP2 gene which encodes membrane bound aminopeptidase (APP) enzyme [1]. The gene is located on the X chromosome. We performed a preliminary investigation to ascertain whether there is any association between AEi and the C2399A SNP genotype in the local Black and Coloured African population in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were randomly recruited from the hypertension clinic at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. EDTA blood samples were collected from patients with a known history of AEi caused by enalapril (n = 24) and controls with hypertension on enalapril with no incidence of AEi for at least 2 years (n = 85). Allele-specific primers were used for the detection of the C or A allele associated with XPNPEP2. Female patients were also being investigated for X-inactivation patterns to detect subtle skewing of the ratio. To date a total of 24 patients with AEi have been tested, 18 were female (75%), 13 coloured (54%) and 11 (46%) Black African. When compared with controls 29% of Black African and 8% of coloured patients attending the hypertension clinic had a history of AEi. There were no gender differences between AEi patients and controls. All male patients exhibited either A or C allele genotypes. All female patients exhibited CC, AA or CA genotypes. In AEi patients the A allele frequency was 16% in males and 26% in females. In controls the A allele frequency was 33% in males and 28% in females. Lyonization of the X allele in females is still being investigated. In conclusion, more female than male and more Black African than coloured patients presented with enalapril-induced angio- edema at the hypertension clinic in Cape Town South Africa.

In species with heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the sex of the individual is established at the time of formation of the zygote, leading to inherent sex differences in expression of sex chromosome genes beginning as soon as the embryonic transcriptome is activated. The inequality of sex chromosome gene expression causes sexual differentiation of the gonads and of non-gonadal tissues. The difference in gonad type in turn causes lifelong differences in gonadal hormones, which interact with unequal effects of X and Y genes acting within cells. Separating the effects of gonadal hormones and sex chromosomes has been possible using mouse models in which gonadal determination is separated from the sex chromosomes, allowing comparison of XX and XY mice with the same type of gonad.

In females, erasure follows loss of X inactivation, causing X dosage excess. Conversely, in males, erasure leads to permanent X dosage decompensation. Sex chromosomally abnormal models exhibit a “sex-reversed” X dosage state: XX males, like XX females, develop X dosage excess, while XO females, like XY males, develop X dosage decompensation.

Although males generally exhibit severe symptoms, due to variable X inactivation, females can also be severely impacted. Osteoporosis is a disease of the skeleton predisposing patients to fragility fracture, a cause of significant morbidity and mortality and a common comorbidity in HA. Because the causes of osteoporosis in HA are unclear and in humans confounded by other traditional risk factors for bone loss, in this study, we phenotyped the skeletons of F8 total knockout (F8TKO) mice, an animal model of severe HA. We found that trabecular bone accretion in the axial and appendicular skeletons of male F8TKO mice lagged significantly between 2 and 6 months of age, with more modest cortical bone decline. By contrast, in female mice, diminished bone accretion was mostly limited to the cortical compartment. Interestingly, bone loss was associated with a decline in bone formation in male mice but increased bone resorption in female mice, a possible result of sex steroid insufficiency. In conclusion, our studies reveal a sexual dimorphism in the mechanism driving bone loss in male and female F8TKO mice, preventing attainment of peak bone mass and strength. If validated in humans, therapies aimed at promoting bone formation in males but suppressing bone resorption in females may be indicated to facilitate attainment of peak mass in children with HA to reduce the risk for fracture later in life.",L2001590511 2019-02-22 2019-03-01,10.1182/bloodadvances.2018027557,amino terminal telopeptide;carboxy terminal telopeptide;collagen type 1;procollagen;sex hormone;animal cell;animal experiment;animal model;animal tissue;appendicular skeleton;article;bone density;bone mass;bone metabolism;bone microarchitecture;bone strength;bone structure;bone turnover;C57BL 6 mouse;cell count;cell surface;controlled study;cortical bone;cortical thickness (bone);dual energy X ray absorptiometry;female;femur;fracture;hemophilia A;juvenile animal;knockout mouse;male;micro-computed tomography;morphometry;mouse;nonhuman;ossification;osteoclast;osteolysis;phenotype;priority journal;risk factor;sex difference;trabecular bone;vertebra;Factor XI Deficiency;Hemophilia A;Bone Resorption;Hemophilia B;Mice;Osteogenesis,,

In fact, the female sex is a significant risk factor for the development of DED. This sex-related difference in DED prevalence is attributed in large part to the effects of sex steroids (e.g. androgens, estrogens), hypothalamic-pituitary hormones, glucocorticoids, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and thyroid hormones, as well as to the sex chromosome complement, sex-specific autosomal factors and epigenetics (e.g. microRNAs). In addition to sex, gender also appears to be a risk factor for DED. “Gender” and “sex” are words that are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings. “Gender” refers to a person's self-representation as a man or woman, whereas “sex” distinguishes males and females based on their biological characteristics. Both gender and sex affect DED risk, presentation of the disease, immune responses, pain, care-seeking behaviors, service utilization, and myriad other facets of eye health. Overall, sex, gender and hormones play a major role in the regulation of ocular surface and adnexal tissues, and in the difference in DED prevalence between women and men.

These species variations result from chance mutations, species differences in the staging of developmental events, and interactions between events that occur concurrently. Such variations, which have only recently been appreciated, do not interfere with the strategy of establishing a single active X, but they influence how it is carried out. In an overview of X dosage compensation in human cells, I point out the evolutionary variations. I also argue that it is the single active X that is chosen, rather than inactive ones. Further, I suggest that the initial events in the process-those that precede silencing of future inactive X chromosomes-include randomly choosing the future active X, most likely by repressing its XIST locus. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",L51466783 2011-06-10 2011-08-12,10.1007/s00439-011-1016-7,hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase;methyl CpG binding protein 2;untranslated RNA;allele;aneuploidy;article;CDX4 gene;cell differentiation;centromere;CHIC1 gene;chromosome replication;CNBP2 gene;CpG island;diploidy;DNA methylation;DNA sequence;embryonic stem cell;evolutionary tinkering;FTX gene;gene;gene deletion;gene expression regulation;gene locus;gene repression;gene silencing;genetic association;genetic transcription;genome imprinting;housekeeping gene;human;Jpx gene;long interspersed nuclear element;monosomy X;NAPIL2 gene;nonhuman;partial trisomy;phenotype;preimplantation embryo;priority journal;RNF12 gene;sex difference;silent gene;spermatogenesis;telomere;tissue differentiation;triploidy;tsix gene;TSX gene;upregulation;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X chromosome linkage;X chromosome linked disorder;XCE gene;xist gene;XITE gene;XPCT gene;Y chromosome;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

R.",,,,,"Females of the human species live longer than males, and the longevity differential is probably not entirely explained by reasons which are presently obvious. Genotypic sex has long been suspected to affect longevity to the advantage of the female. Several recent findings about the X and Y chromosomes must be reckoned with in considering determinants of longevity which derive from genotypic sex. The advantages of having two X chromosomes are apparent, notwithstanding X-chromosome inactivation. Not only can some cells compensate for biosynthetic deficiencies of others, but also cell selection according to which X chromosome is active can occur during development according to cell viability and proliferative capacity. It has recently been observed that at least some genes on inactive X chromosomes are reactivated late in life. Details of the reactivation process must be studied to determine its significance and the effects of the process on late life survival. The recent mapping of the catalytic polypeptide of DNA-polymerase-alpha to the X chromosome calls attention to a new property of the genotype which could affect the basic ability of cells to proliferate. It is likely that this enzyme, perhaps in concert with DNA-polymerase-delta, is required for DNA replication, suggesting that two alleles for this enzyme and cell selection within the female phenotypic mosaic for DNA replication may provide a sex-linked determinant of cell proliferation which could be advantageous in late life. Much remains to be learned about the Y chromosome, although there are early results consistent with a determinant of longevity on that chromosome which operates to the male disadvantage and probably does not involve sex hormones. The genotype may be a significant determinant of longevity in humans even if it does not appear to be so in non-human animals, because causes of death are different. Determinants of longevity are based on susceptibility or vulnerability to the causes and diseases of mortality, and these differ in different species.","Smith, D W Warner, H R Journal Article Review England 1989/01/01 Exp Gerontol. 1989;24(4):277-88. doi: 10.1016/0531-5565(89)90001-6.",10.1016/0531-5565(89)90001-6,Female;Genotype;Humans;*Longevity;Male;Sex Factors;Longevity,,

Among 175 Israeli patients with unexplained cryptogenic stroke screened for mutations in the Fabry α galactosidase A (GLA) gene, sequencing identified six with 2-4 GLA intronic variants, one of whose father and three sisters had the same variants. Two variants, c.640-16A>G (g.10115A>G) in intron 4 and c.1000-22C>T (g.10956C>T) in intron 6, were common to all patients. However, three males with a common four variant intronic haplotype had low residual enzyme activity and ~50% reduced mRNA expression. Transcript splice-site defects were not identified in any of the index cases and X-chromosome inactivation was not highly skewed in the six females.

However, some X-linked genes show variable X inactivation, being expressed from the inactive X in some females but subject to inactivation in other women. The human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP1) gene falls into this category. As TIMP1 and its target metalloproteinases are involved in many biological processes, women with elevated TIMP1 expression may exhibit different disease susceptibilities. To address the potential impact of variable X inactivation, we analyzed TIMP1 expression levels by using an RNase protection assay. The substantial variation of TIMP1 expression observed in cells with monoallelic TIMP1 expression precluded analysis of the contribution of the inactive X to total TIMP1 RNA levels in females, so we examined expression in rodent/human somatic cell hybrids. TIMP1 expression levels varied more widely in hybrids retaining an inactive X than in those with an active X chromosome, suggesting variable retention of the epigenetic silencing mechanisms associated with X inactivation. Therefore, we investigated the contribution of methylation at the promoter to expression level variation and found that methylation of the TIMP1 promoter correlated with instability and low level expression, whereas stable TIMP1 expression from the inactive X equivalent to that seen from the active X chromosome was observed when the promoter was unmethylated. Since all female cell lines examined showed methylation of the TIMP1 promoter, the contribution of expression from the inactive X appears minimal. However, as women age, they may accumulate cells stably expressing TIMP1 from the inactive X, with a resulting increase of TIMP1, which may explain some sex differences in various late-onset disorders. © Springer-Verlag 2002.",L36067448 2003-01-22,10.1007/s00439-002-0676-8,metalloproteinase;protein;RNA;tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1;age;allele;article;cell aggregation;cell line;chromosome inactivation;controlled study;correlation function;disease predisposition;DNA methylation;female;gene expression;gene silencing;genetic variability;human;human cell;hybrid cell;lymphoblast;male;nonhuman;onset age;priority journal;promoter region;protein expression;protein targeting;rat;ribonuclease protection assay;rodent;sex difference;somatic cell;X chromosome;X chromosome linkage;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;X Chromosome,,

We assessed whether (CAG)n affects the sequence of the androgen-sensitive pubertal events and body composition in prepubertal girls. Design, Setting, Participants, and Interventions: Nested case-control study within the Growth and Obesity Cohort Study of 1196 low-middle income children (approximately 50% girls) from a university clinic in Santiago, Chile. Cases were girls with high dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS; >42 μg/dL; HD) at age 7.0 (±0.4) years (n = 58). On follow-up, 32 of them had thelarche (TB2) before the age of pubarche (PH2) and 26 had PH2 before the age of TB2. As controls, 107 age-matched girls with normal DHEAS (≤42 μg/dL; ND) were selected. Main Outcome Measures: Methylation-weighted mean (CAG)n (mw[CAG]n) was calculated through X-chromosome methylation-sensitive enzyme restriction and polymerase chain reaction followed by automated capillary electrophoresis in peripheral blood DNA. Results: Girls with HD and PH2 before the age of TB2 showed a trend to higher frequency (7/26, 26.9%) of mw(CAG)n <20 compared with ND girls (12/107; 11.2%; P =.087). Accordingly, a direct correlation between age of PH2 and mw(CAG)n was observed in HD (r = 0.352; P =.007) and in ND girls (r = 0.207; P =.033). Moreover, HD girls with mw(CAG)n less than 20 had lower waist circumference and waist/height ratio than HD girls with mw(CAG)n from 20 to less than 25 (P =.027 and P =.012, respectively) at age of DHEAS determination.

Structural equation modeling was used to model a female problem behavior phenotype, which included conduct problems, substance use, impulsive-sensation seeking, interpersonal aggression, and prenatal smoking. All of the female problem behavior dimensions clustered together strongly, with the exception of prenatal smoking. A main effect of MAOA genotype and a MAOA x physical maltreatment interaction were detected with the Conduct Problems factor. Our phenotypic model showed that prenatal smoking is not simply a marker of other maternal problem behaviors.

E. and MacGregor, A.",,,,,"The aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has both genetic and environmental origins. However, the relationship of these with each other and with RA disease is complicated as both genes and environment may be protective or render individuals susceptible. Diagnostic certainty and disease heterogeneity have posed serious hurdles for investigating RA. Patients with similar disease phenotypes may have different aetiologies and it may now be more appropriate to investigate genetic susceptibility with respect to disease process or characteristic immunopathology. Disease concordance studies have been a classical approach to estimating the upper threshold of the genetic contribution to RA and recent studies have approximately halved the much quoted figure of 32% reported by Lawrence for RA concordance in monozygotic twins. However, the interpretation of twin data has to be treated with caution as MZ twins can differ in terms of somatic rearrangement/mutation of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes, X chromosome inactivation in females, genomic imprinting and in utero immune relationship. Calculations based on heritability put the genetic component in RA much higher. HLA is an important genetic factor in RA and risk is thought to be associated with a consensus sequence of amino acids within the third hypervariable region of certain DRB1 alleles. It is now clear that HLA is not particularly associated with onset of synovitis but is more associated with progression and severity of the disease process. The HLA-DRB1*0401/0404 genotype is particularly associated with severe, erosive and seropositive RA. Clear differences in RA susceptibility exist between males and females and this may be attributed to hormonal status. Males have a higher threshold requirement for developing RA and this may explain why RA in males is more associated with HLA risk alleles. We have now reached a critical time for the investigation of RA aetio-pathology. Recent advances in molecular biology and automated microsatellite gene scanning technology are making it possible to map disease susceptibility genes over the whole genome in common disorders such as RA. This will require large numbers of well characterised multiplex affected families. It is anticipated that some of the genes identified will fit in with our current concepts of which inflammatory and immune processes are pathologically important in RA. However others may be a major surprise.","Ollier, W E MacGregor, A Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review England 1995/04/01 Br Med Bull. 1995 Apr;51(2):267-85. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a072960.",10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a072960,"Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*genetics;Diseases in Twins;Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Female;Gene Rearrangement;Genetic Heterogeneity;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;HLA Antigens/genetics;Humans;Male;Sex Factors;Twin Studies as Topic;Molecular Epidemiology",,

Using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, we analyzed 57 MspI sites (32 sites in the CpG islands, and 25 nonclustered sites) from five X-linked housekeeping genes (HPRT, G6PD, P3, PGK, and GLA) and two tissue specific genes (X-linked F9 and autosomal EPO). Methylation patterns were compared to those of male germ cells, sperm, and somatic tissues of both sexes. All 32 MspI sites in CpG islands were unmethylated in germ-cell fractions of fetal ovary and adult testes, which could explain the reversibility of X inactivation in these tissues. However, whereas male meiotic germ cells were extensively methylated outside the islands (in the body of genes) and the methylation patterns resembled those of most somatic tissues, none of the 25 nonclustered CpGs was methylated in DNA contributed by the germ-cell component of fetal ovaries. The presence of faint MspI-like fragments in HpaII digests of fetal testes as well as fetal ovary prior to the onset of meiosis suggests that DNA of primordial germ cells is unmethylated in both sexes. Our observations of meiotic germ cells suggest that the female germ cells remain unmethylated, but that methylation in male germ cells occurs postnatally, prior to or during the early stages of spermatogenesis. In any event, the striking sex difference in methylation status of endogenous single-copy genes in meiotic germ cells could provide a molecular basis for parental imprinting of the mammalian genome.",L20214475 1990-08-17,10.1007/bf01233363,radioisotope;article;cell culture;DNA methylation;human;human cell;nonhuman;normal human;priority journal;sex difference;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Sex Characteristics;X Chromosome,,

In humans, PCDH11X has a homologue on the Y chromosome and is predicted to escape from X-inactivation. Employing bisulphite sequencing analysis we found absence of CpG island methylation on both the active and the inactive X chromosomes, providing a strong indication that PCDH11X escapes inactivation in humans. Furthermore, a sexual dimorphism in levels of expression in brain tissue was observed by quantitative real-time PCR, with females presenting an up to 2-fold excess in the abundance of PCDH11X transcripts. We relate these findings to sexually dimorphic traits in the human brain.

We also examined mice in which the testis-determining gene Sry is deleted from the Y chromosome but inserted onto an autosome as a transgene, producing XX and XY gonadal females and XX and XY gonadal males. At birth, Trp53 nullizygous mice were predominantly XY rather than XX, irrespective of gonadal type, showing that the sex difference in the lethal effect of Trp53 nullizygosity by postnatal day 1 is caused by differences in sex chromosome complement. At 10.5 dpc, the incidence of NTDs in Trp53-null progeny of XY* mice, among which the number of the X chromosomes varies independently of the presence or absence of a Y chromosome, was higher in mice with two copies of the X chromosome than in mice with a single copy.

Here we report two affected female patients with OFCD, a mother and daughter, who both had congenital cataracts, microphthalmia, characteristic dental anomalies, and typical facial dysmorphisms.

In Family 1, a 19-year-old male had facial features consistent with fragile X syndrome; however, his profound mental and growth retardation, small testes, and lover limb skeletal defects and contractures demonstrated a more severe phenotype, suggestive of a contiguous gene syndrome. A cytogenetic deletion including Xq26.3-q27.3 was observed in the proband, his phenotypically normal mother, and his learning-disabled non-dysmorphic sister. Methylation analyses at the FMR1 and androgen receptor loci indicated that the deleted X was inactive in > 95% of his mother's white blood cells and 80-85% of the sister's leukocytes. The proximal breakpoint for the deletion was approximately 10 Mb centromeric to FMR1, and the distal breakpoint mapped 1 Mb distal to FMR1. This deletion, encompassing ~ 13 Mb of DNA, is the largest deletion including FMR1 reported to date. In the second family, a slightly smaller deletion was detected. A female with moderate to severe mental retardation, seizures, and hypothyroidism, had a de novo cytogenetic deletion extending from Xq26.3 to q27.3, which removed ~ 12 Mb of DNA around the FMR1 gene. Cytogenetic and molecular data revealed that ~ 50% of her white blood cells contained an active deleted X. These findings indicate that males with deletions including Xq26.3-q27.3 may exhibit a more severe phenotype than typical fragile X males, and females with similar deletions may have an abnormal phenotype if the deleted X remains active in a significant proportion of the cells. Thus, important genes for intellectual and neurological development, in addition to FMR1, may reside in Xq26.3-q27.3.

Furthermore, investigating sex biases that might influence lncRNA-regulated responses will likely reveal contributions toward the observed disparities between the sexes in metabolic diseases.","1545-4312 Lovell, Claudia D Anguera, Montserrat C R01 AI134834/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review United States 2022/04/19 Annu Rev Nutr. 2022 Aug 22;42:251-274. doi: 10.1146/annurev-nutr-062220-030244.

Alterations in DNA methylation are established contributors to inter-individual phenotypic variation and have been associated with disease susceptibility. The degree to which changes in loci-specific DNA methylation are under the influence of heritable and environmental factors is unknown. In this study, we quantitatively measured DNA methylation across the promoter regions of the dopamine receptor 4 gene (DRD4), the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4/SERT) and the monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA) using DNA sampled at both ages 5 and 10 years in 46 MZ twin-pairs and 45 DZ twin-pairs (total n = 182). We observed high levels of MZ twin discordance in DNA methylation and dynamic changes in individual DNA methylation across all three regions between ages 5 and 10 years. Variation in DRD4 DNA methylation was mostly attributable to environmental factors that were shared among children growing up in the same family whilst inter-individual differences in SERT DNA methylation were primarily attributable to unique environmental factors experienced by each child in the family, and not to shared events or heritable factors. We observed a more complex pattern of results for the MAOA amplicon with noticeable sex differences in twin concordance at both ages and for change over time, as expected for a gene mediated by X-inactivation. Our longitudinaldevelopmental study suggests that DNA methylation differences are apparent already in early childhood and there are DNA methylation differences between genetically identical individuals (i.e. MZ twins). Moreover, environmental influences are important factors accounting for interindividual DNA methylation differences and individual differences in methylation over time are not stable. While these findings confirm the utility of DNA methylation as a biomarker of environmental influences, they also identify new and important concerns about using cross-sectional approaches to studying and drawing inferences in epigenomics.",L70236572 2010-08-18,,DNA;biological marker;amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme A;serotonin transporter;dopamine receptor;twins;longitudinal study;DNA methylation;gene;environmental factor;child;methylation;gene expression;phenotypic variation;disease predisposition;promoter region;twin discordance;amplicon;sex difference;twin concordance;X chromosome inactivation;childhood;Longitudinal Studies;Twins,,

This random X-inactivation process also occurs during in vitro differentiation of female embryonic stem (ES) cells. A locus on the X chromosome, the X inactivation centre (Xic) is initially 'counted', given that at least two copies of Xic must be present per diploid genome in order for inactivation to occur. The counting process ensures that one X chromosome remains active in diploid cells. In the mouse, the essential functions of Xic can be assured by a 450-kb region containing the Xist gene. Xist maps within Xic (refs 7-10) and is necessary in cis for inactivation. The Xist transcript is a 15-kb RNA which is confined within the nucleus and coats the inactive X chromosome. In order to characterize functional elements within Xic and the Xist gene, we created a 65-kb cre/loxP deletion extending 3' to Xist exon 6. In undifferentiated ES cells, Xist expression from the deleted X chromosome was markedly reduced. In differentiated XX ES cells containing one deleted X chromosome, the X inactivation process still occurred but was never initiated from the unmutated X chromosome. In differentiated ES cells that were essentially XO, the mutated Xic was capable of initiating X inactivation, even in the absence of another Xic. These results demonstrate a role for the region 3' to Xist exon 6 in the counting process and suggest that counting is mediated by a repressive mechanism which prevents inactivation of a single X chromosome in diploid cells.",L28309335 1998-08-20,10.1038/924,animal cell;article;cell death;cell differentiation;deletion mutant;diploidy;embryo development;exon;gene locus;gene mapping;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;priority journal;sex difference;stem cell;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome;Exons,,

To determine a putative association of skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and PD, we examined XCI patterns using a human androgen receptor gene-based assay (HUMARA) and did not identify any association of skewed or random X inactivation with clinical heterogeneity among female PD patients. In addition, we sought to determine methylation-specific changes at the X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) locus, which is known to be responsible for initiating X inactivation. We observed a trend towards hypomethylation in the gene body region of the XIST locus in PD females which did not reach significance. Furthermore, we extended our analysis of DNA methylation across the entire X-chromosome which revealed no methylation-specific differences between PD females and healthy controls.

CB6F1 male mice exhibited high susceptibility and B6CF1 male mice exhibited low susceptibility, indicating a major X-linked effect in the genetic control of UV immune suppression. Females of either F1 hybrid showed intermediate suppression, consistent with random X-inactivation. A model of monogenic X-linked control was not sufficient, and evidence for the action of two genetically unlinked autosomal genes was found in parental backcross animals. Both sexes of (BALB/c x CB6F1) mice showed a 1 high : 1 low ratio of phenotypes, indicating control by a major autosomal locus, Uvs1, confirmed by propagation of the high phenotype through selective backcrossing for nine generations to BALB/c. Uvs1 was not genetically linked to 12 chromosomal markers including the pigment genes b (brown) and c (albino). Backcross animals (C57BL/6 x CB6F1) showed a significant sex difference, male mice giving a 3 high : 1 low ratio of phenotypes, compatible with the action of a second autosomal locus, Uvs2, in this hybrid. The findings are compatible with a model in which high phenotype (Uvs1b/Uvs1b) is dominant when subjected to recessive epistatis by the X-chromosome locus Uvs3, or by the autosomal locus Uvs2.

Traditionally, in mammals, sex determination is considered equivalent to gonadal determination. Since the presence or the absence of the testes ultimately determines the phenotype of the external genitalia, sex determination is typically seen as equivalent to testis determination. But what exactly does sex determine? The endpoint of sex determination is almost invariably seen as the reproductive structures, which represent the most obvious phenotypic difference between the sexes. One could argue that the most striking differences between males and females are not the anatomy of the genitals, but the size of the gametes-considerably larger in females than males. In fact, there could be many different endpoints to sex determination, leading to differences between the sexes: brain sexual differences, behavioral differences, and susceptibility to disease. The central dogma of sexual differentiation, stemming initially from the gonad-transfer experiments of Alfred Jost, is that sexual dimorphisms of all somatic tissues are dependent on the testicular secretion of the developing fetus. In this chapter, we will take the example of sex differences in brain and behavior as an endpoint of sex determination. We will argue that genetic factors play a role in sexually dimorphic traits such as the number of dopaminergic cells in the mesencephalon, aggression, and sexual orientation, independently from gonadal hormones.

Here we show that CpG island methylation is abnormal in some ICF patients but in other ICF patients, the difference in methylation pattern between Xi and Xa (active X) is maintained. The consequences of Xi undermethylation on gene expression were investigated by enzyme assays. They showed that significant gene expression did not correlate with CpG island methylation status. The widespread Xi undermethylation does not affect overall Xi replication timing and does not prevent Barr body formation suggesting that a normal methylation pattern is not required for normal chromatin organization of Xi.

Due to recessive inheritance, males are affected, while female carriers are usually asymptomatic with a wide range of factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX) levels. Bleeding tendency in female carriers is extremely variable and may be associated with low clotting factor levels. This could be explained by F8 or F9 genetic variations, numerical or structural X chromosomal anomalies, or epigenetic variations such as irregular X chromosome inactivation (XCI). The aim of the study was to determine whether low FVIII or FIX coagulant activity in haemophilia carriers could be related to XCI and bleeding symptoms. HUMARA assay was performed on 73 symptomatic carriers with low clotting activity ≤50 IU/dL. Bleeding Assessment Tool (BAT) from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) was used to describe symptoms in the cohort of carriers. In 97% of haemophilia carriers, a specific gene variant in heterozygous state was found, which alone could not justify their low FVIII or FIX levels (≤50 IU/dL). A statistical association between XCI pattern and FVIII and FIX levels was observed. Moreover, female carriers with low coagulant activity (≤20 IU/dL) and high degree of XCI (≥ 80:20) had a higher ISTH-BAT score than the carriers with the opposite conditions (>20 IU/dL and <80:20).

J.",,,,,"Sex chromosomes originate as a pair of homologus autosomes that then follow a general pattern of divergence. This is evident in mammalian sex chromosomes, which have undergone stepwise recombination suppression events that left footprints of evolutionary strata on the X chromosome. The loss of genes on the Y chromosome led to Ohno's hypothesis of dosage equivalence between XY males and XX females, which is achieved through X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). This process transcriptionally silences all but one X chromosome in each female cell, although 15-30% of human X-linked genes still escape inactivation. There are multiple evolutionary pathways that may lead to a gene escaping XCI, including remaining Y chromosome homology, or female advantage to escape. The conservation of some escape genes across multiple species and the ability of the mouse inactive X to recapitulate human escape status both suggest that escape from XCI is controlled by conserved processes. Evolutionary pressures to minimize dosage imbalances have led to the accumulation of genetic elements that favor either silencing or escape; lack of dosage sensitivity might also allow for the escape of flanking genes near another escapee, if a boundary element is not present between them. Delineation of the elements involved in escape is progressing, but mechanistic understanding of how they interact to allow escape from XCI is still lacking. Although increasingly well-studied in humans and mice, non-trivial challenges to studying escape have impeded progress in other species. Mouse models that can dissect the role of the sex chromosomes distinct from sex of the organism reveal an important contribution for escape genes to multiple diseases. In humans, with their elevated number of escape genes, the phenotypic consequences of sex chromosome aneuplodies and sexual dimorphism in disease both highlight the importance of escape genes.","2296-634x Posynick, Bronwyn J Brown, Carolyn J Journal Article Review Switzerland 2019/11/07 Front Cell Dev Biol. 2019 Oct 22;7:241. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2019.00241. eCollection 2019.",10.3389/fcell.2019.00241,X-chromosome inactivation;dosage compensation;escape from X-chromosome inactivation;gametologues;mammalian evolution;sex chromosomes;X Chromosome,,

Despite this chromosome-wide silencing, a number of genes escape X inactivation: in women about 15% of X-linked genes are bi-allelically expressed and in mice, about 3%. Expression from the inactive X allele varies from a few percent of that from the active allele to near equal expression. While most genes have a stable inactivation pattern, a subset of genes exhibit tissue-specific differences in escape from X inactivation. Escape genes appear to be protected from the repressive chromatin modifications associated with X inactivation. Differences in the identity and distribution of escape genes between species and tissues suggest a role for these genes in the evolution of sex differences in specific phenotypes.

He is childless after 13 years of marriage. There is no history of infectious disease or trauma. Physical examination revealed testicular hypotrophy. The male genital tract and secondary sex characteristics were normal. R banding revealed a translocation between the long arm of chromosome 1 and chromosome 13. C banding showed that the breakpoint in chromosome 1 had occurred within the centromeric heterochromatin. Part of the heterochromatin region was translocated onto the short arm of chromosome 13, thus forming a dicentric chromosome. The abnormal chromosome 1 consisted of the short arm and a small region of centromeric heterochromatin. No part of chromosome 13 was apparently translocated onto chromosome 1. Ag staining showed that the translocated 1;13 chromosome retained the active NORs and was participating in satellite association. No chromosome studies on the family have yet been possible. It would be interesting to establish through family studies if the translocation is de novo or inherited. A de novo event is more likely in view of the non-reciprocal nature of the rearrangement. The important question is to determine the relationship between infertility and observed chromosomal anomalies in infertile men. In sex chromosome aneuploidies the association is obvious. The role of autosomal rearrangements is more difficult to explain. It seems unlikely that spermatogenic arrest in heterozygotes for chromosome rearrangements could be the result of altered expression of genes at (or near) the chromosome breakpoint, as too many genes would have to be involved in spermatogenesis. Perhaps the hypothesis of Forejt provides a better explanation.

A suppressor of the selfish growth effects would be expected to spread were it to have an appropriate parent-specific expression rule. A suppressor could act by boosting the resource demands of competing female embryos. This possibility may explain incidences of the escape from X-inactivation and provides a rationale for why these genes typically have Y-linked homologues. Alternatively, a suppressor could act to decrease the resource demands of males with the selfish Y. This possibility is supported by the finding that the size of male, but not female, human infants is negatively correlated to the number of X chromosomes. A protracted arms race between a selfish gene and its suppressor may ensue. Both the variation in copy number of Zfy and the unusually fast sequence evolution of Sry may be explained by such an arms race. As required by the model, human Sry is known to have an X-linked suppressor. Preliminary evidence suggests that, as predicted, rapid sequence evolution of Sry may be correlated with female promiscuity. The case for fast sequence evolution as the product of maternal/foetal conflict is strengthened by consideration of the rapid evolution of placental lactogens in both ruminants and rodents.","Hurst, L D Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review England 1994/09/01 Heredity (Edinb). 1994 Sep;73 ( Pt 3):233-43. doi: 10.1038/hdy.1994.128.",10.1038/hdy.1994.128,"Animals;Female;Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental;Genes, Suppressor/physiology;Genetic Linkage;Humans;Imprinting, Psychological/*physiology;Maternal-Fetal Exchange;Pregnancy;Sex Ratio;X Chromosome/*physiology;Y Chromosome/*physiology",,

In humans, they reside at the ends of the X and Y chromosomes and encompass roughly 2.7 Mb (PAR1) and 0.33 Mb (PAR2). As a major asset of recently available sequence data, our view of their structural characteristics could be refined considerably. While PAR2 resembles the overall sequence composition of the X chromosome and exhibits only slightly elevated recombination rates, PAR1 is characterized by a significantly higher GC content and a completely different repeat structure. In addition, it exhibits one of the highest recombination frequencies throughout the entire human genome and, probably as a consequence of its structural features, displays a significantly faster rate of evolution. It therefore represents an exceptional model to explore the correlation between meiotic recombination and evolutionary forces such as gene mutation and conversion. At least twenty-nine genes lie within the human pseudoautosomal regions, and these genes exhibit 'autosomal' rather than sex-specific inheritance. All genes within PAR1 escape X inactivation and are therefore candidates for the etiology of haploinsufficiency disorders including Turner syndrome (45,X). However, the only known disease gene within the pseudoautosomal regions is the SHORT STATURE HOMEBOX (SHOX) gene, functional loss of which is causally related to various short stature conditions and disturbed bone development.

In the current study weanling C56BL/6J mice were used to examine sex differences in the Calb protein and message focusing on regions outside of the hypothalamus. A robust sex difference was found in Calb in the frontal cortex (FC) and cerebellum (CB; specifically in Purkinje cells); mRNA and protein were higher in females than in males. Using 2 mouse lines, i.e. one with a complete deletion of estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and the other with uncoupled gonads and sex chromosomes, we probed the mechanisms that underlie sexual dimorphisms. In the FC, deletion of ER alpha reduced Calb1 mRNA in females compared to males. In addition, females with XY sex chromosomes had levels of Calb1 equal to those of males. Thus, both ER alpha and the sex chromosome complement regulate Calb1 in the FC. In the CB, ER alpha knockout mice of both sexes had reduced Calb1 mRNA, yet sex differences were retained. However, the sex chromosome complement, regardless of gonadal sex, dictated Calb1 mRNA levels. Mice with XX chromosomes had significantly greater Calb1 than did XY mice.

Historically, it was argued that such differences were largely, if not exclusively, due to gonadal hormone secretions. However, emerging research has shown that some differences are mediated by mechanisms other than the action of these hormone secretions and in particular by products of genes located on the X and Y chromosomes, which we refer to as direct genetic effects. This paper reviews the evidence for direct genetic effects in behavioral and brain sex differences. We highlight the 'four core genotypes' model and sex differences in the midbrain dopaminergic system, specifically focusing on the role of Sty. We also discuss novel research being done on unique populations including people attracted to the same sex and people with a cross-gender identity. As science continues to advance our understanding of biological sex differences, a new field is emerging that is aimed at better addressing the needs of both sexes: gender-based biology and medicine. Ultimately, the study of the biological basis for sex differences will improve healthcare for both men and women. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Uniquely, thyroid cancer (TC) is the only nonreproductive cancer with striking female predominance with three- to four-fold higher incidence among females, although males generally have more aggressive disease. The molecular basis for this observation is not known, and current approaches in treatment and surveillance are not sex specific. Summary: Although TC has overall good prognosis, 6-20% of patients develop regional or distant metastasis, one third of whom are not responsive to conventional treatment approaches and suffer a 10-year survival rate of only 10%. More efficacious treatment strategies are needed for these aggressive TCs, as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy have major toxicities without demonstrable overall survival benefit. Emerging evidence indicates a role of sex hormones, genetics, and the immune system in modulation of both risk for TC and its progression in a sex-specific manner. Conclusion: Greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying sex differences in TC pathogenesis could provide insights into the development of sex-specific, targeted, and effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management.

Moreover, the terms sex and gender are used interchangeably by many researchers, further complicating the issue. In addition, the sex or gender of the researcher might influence study outcomes, especially those concerning behavioral studies, in both animals and humans. The act of observation may change the outcome (the ""observer effect"") and any experimental manipulation, no matter how well-controlled, is subject to it. This is nowhere more applicable than in physiology and behavior. The sex of established cultured cell lines is another issue, in addition to aneuploidy; chromosomal numbers can change as cells are passaged.

Our aim was to characterize both protein-coding and long non-coding sex-specific transcripts in healthy human placenta using RNA-seq. METHODS: We sequenced total RNA from 88 well phenotyped healthy placentas (40 female and 48 male) collected as part of the Pregnancy Outcome Prediction study in which the placental sample was obtained within 30 minutes of delivery (healthy individual=no hypertension during pregnancy, no diabetes mellitus, delivered a live baby with a birth percentile >=10). We performed quality assessment, trimming and mapping using FastQC, Trim Galore!, and TopHat respectively. Differential gene expression analysis was carried out using edgeR. We validated the significant transcripts in an independent set of 24 samples (12 male-female breech pairs, delivered at term by elective C-section and matched for maternal age, BMI and smoking status). RESULTS: We obtained an average of 102 million reads per sample. We identified 243 differentially-regulated transcripts (DRTs) in the discovery set (FDR<0.05) and validated 84 of these (36 up- and 48 down-regulated in females). Interestingly, 26/84 (31%) DRTs were non-coding RNAs: 18/29 on the Y chr, 6/35 on the X chr and 2/20 on the autosomes. As expected, none of the Y chr transcripts were expressed in females. 28 X chr genes had higher levels of expression in females, indicating escape from X inactivation. But, surprisingly, we also identified 7 protein-coding X chr genes which demonstrated higher levels of expression in males (at least 3 located in the pseudoautosomal regions). 11 protein-coding Y chr genes were expressed in the placenta. All of these had an X chr paralog but only 6 of the X chr paralogs demonstrated escape from X inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Male and female placenta show sex-specific transcript profile differences, and approximately one third are non-coding RNA. (2) Most (76%) DRTs in human placenta are X- or Y-linked. (3) 6/11 X chr genes with an expressed Y chr paralog demonstrated escape from X inactivation, but the remaining 5 did not. (4) Overall, our findings indicate multiple mechanisms leading to sex-specific variation in placental expression of protein coding genes, plus a large number of validated differences in non-protein coding DRTs.",L615322989 2017-04-17,10.1177/1933719117699773,endogenous compound;transcriptome;untranslated RNA;autosome;body mass;controlled study;diabetes mellitus;disease course;DNA transcription;female;gene expression regulation;human;infant;low level laser system;major clinical study;male;maternal age;maternal hypertension;normal human;obstetric delivery;paralogy;placenta;prediction;pregnancy outcome;pseudoautosomal region;quality control;smoking;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Transcriptome;Placenta,,

RTT is caused by heterozygosity for mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2, which encodes methyl-CpG binding protein 2. MeCP2 is a multifunctional protein that can act as an architectural chromatin-binding protein, a function that is unrelated to its ability to bind methyl-CpG and to attract chromatin modification complexes. Inactivating mutations that cause RTT in females are not prenatally lethal in males, but lead to profound congenital encephalopathy. Molecular diagnoses of RTT, through demonstration of a MECP2 mutation, made at an early stage of the disorder, usually confirm the sporadic nature and very low recurrence risk of the condition. A positive DNA test result, however, also predicts the inevitable clinical course, given the lack of effective intervention. Initial hypotheses indicating that the MeCP2 protein acts as a genome-wide transcriptional repressor were not confirmed by global gene expression studies in various tissues of individuals with RTT and mouse models of MeCP2 deficiency.

This leads to pathological glycosphingolipid metabolism, resulting in deposition of glycosphingolipids in lysosomes and body fluids. There is evidence that the glycolipids also accumulate extralysosomally, which is a very important factor in the pathogenic impact. Cardiac involvement is one of the most important disease manifestations because the patients mainly die from cardiac complications. There are two phenotypes: classic and later-onset. First symptoms of the classic phenotype occur during the childhood and include angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, cornea verticillata, and tortuosity of conjunctival and retinal vessels. Young patients typically suffer from acroparaesthesias, abdominal cramping and pain crises. With advancing age, the progressive sphingolipid deposition, particularly in the endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes and podocytes, leads to arterial hypertension, cardiomyopathy, nephropathy and premature strokes. In contrast to the classic phenotype, patients with the later-onset phenotype lack the early disease symptoms. They typically present to the hospital in adulthood with cardiomyopathy or with nephropathy. In females, alpha-galactosidase A activity can range from low to normal owing to random X-chromosome inactivation. Generally, females have a milder phenotype because of the second, unaffected X-chromosome. Patients with Fabry cardiomyopathy suffer from left ventricular hypertrophy, conduction abnormalities and valvular involvement, as well as from diastolic and/or systolic heart failure symptoms. The enzyme activity determination in leucocytes is diagnostic in males but can be misleading in females owing to random X-chromosome deactivation. Thus, genetic testing is suitable for the diagnosis in females and should also be performed in males for the confirmation of the diagnosis. Since 2001, intravenous enzyme replacement therapy has been available for the treatment of patients with Fabry disease. Since 2016, oral pharmacological chaperone therapy has been available for patients with amenable mutations.

Nevertheless, our comprehension of how CVD progresses in women and elicits clinical outcomes is lacking, leading CVD to be under-diagnosed and under-treated in women. A clear example of this differential presentation of CVD pathophysiologies in females is the strikingly higher prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Women with a history of pre-eclampsia or those who present with co-morbidities such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of developing HFpEF. Long understood to be a critical CVD risk factor, our understanding of how gender differentially affects the development of CVD has been greatly expanded by extensive genomic and transcriptomic studies. These studies uncovered a pivotal role for differential microRNA (miRNA) expression in response to systemic inflammation, where their co-ordinated expression forms a post-transcriptional regulatory network that instigates microcirculation defects. Importantly, the potential sex-biased expression of the given miRNAs may explain sex-specific cardiovascular pathophysiologies in women, such as HFpEF. Sex-biased miRNAs are regulated by oestrogen (E2) in their transcription and processing or are expressed from loci on the X-chromosome due to incomplete X-chromosome inactivation. Interestingly, while E2-induced miRNAs predominantly appear to serve protective functions, it could be argued that many X-linked miRNAs have been found to challenge microvascular and myocardial integrity. Therefore, menopausal E2 deficiency, resulting in protective miRNA loss, and the augmentation of X-linked miRNA expression, may well contribute to the molecular mechanisms that underlie the female-specific cardiovascular aetiology in HFpEF.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 48 Total Times Cited: 49 Cited Reference Count: 200,10.1093/cvr/cvx223,Women;Sex-biased miRNAs;HFpEF;Microvascular injury;HUMAN ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS;BREAST-CANCER CELLS;PRESSURE-OVERLOAD HYPERTROPHY;LEFT-VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY;ESTROGEN PLUS PROGESTIN;SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS;NITRIC-OXIDE;CIRCULATING MICRORNAS;POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN;INSULIN SENSITIVITY;Cardiovascular Diseases;Heart Failure,,

This peculiarity of gene expression may be a remnant of the evolutionary history of the sex chromosomes, the pairing segment of which may involve at least 27% of Xp and 95% of Yp. Crossing over seems to occur mostly in the terminal third of the X/Y pairing segment. However, crossing-over inhibition control may lapse, or may be somewhat variable, within the pairing segment, so that some loci on the X and Y (e.g. Xg, H-Y, STS, and perhaps others) might cross over with a variable frequency which is proportional to their distances from the telomeres of the short arms. It is postulated that the DNA of the pairing segment is composed in a way which may also permit unequal crossing over to occur between the X and Y, thereby giving rise to exceptions to X- or Y-linked inheritance.

X gene dosage is then equalized between the sexes through the process of X chromosome inactivation (XCI). Whether the double dose of X-linked genes in females compared with males leads to sex-specific developmental differences has remained unclear. Using embryonic stem cells with distinct sex chromosome compositions as a model system, we show that two X chromosomes stabilize the naive pluripotent state by inhibiting MAPK and Gsk3 signaling and stimulating the Akt pathway. Since MAPK signaling is required to exit the pluripotent state, differentiation is paused in female cells as long as both X chromosomes are active. By preventing XCI or triggering it precociously, we demonstrate that this differentiation block is released once XX cells have undergone X inactivation. We propose that double X dosage interferes with differentiation, thus ensuring a tight coupling between X chromosome dosage compensation and development. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",L372345953 2014-02-19 2014-02-21,10.1016/j.stem.2013.11.022,mitogen activated protein kinase;protein kinase B;animal cell;article;cell differentiation;chromosomal instability;controlled study;embryonic stem cell;female;intracellular signaling;mouse;nonhuman;pluripotent stem cell;priority journal;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome,,

A similar comparison between X-linked entries and a subset of randomly chosen entries from the remaining autosomes also indicates an excess of genes on the X chromosome with one or more mutations affecting sex determination (e.g. DAX1), sexual differentiation (e.g. androgen receptor) or reproduction (e.g. POF1). A possible reason for disproportionate occurrence of such genes on the X chromosome could be that, during evolution, the 'choice' of a particular pair of homomorphic chromosomes for specialization as sex chromosomes may be related to the number of such genes initially present in it or, since sex determination and sexual dimorphism are often gene dose-dependent processes, the number of such genes necessary to be regulated in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis of these data shows that XAR, the region which has been added on to the short arm of the X chromosome subsequent to eutherian-marsupial divergence, has nearly as high a proportion of SRR genes as XCR, the conserved region of the X chromosome. These observations are consistent with current hypotheses on the evolution of sexually antagonistic traits on sex chromosomes and suggest that both XCR and XAR may have accumulated SRR traits relatively rapidly because of X linkage.",L29048017 1999-02-02,10.1098/rspb.1999.0623,"article;autosome;evolution;gene dosage;gene mutation;human;priority journal;reproduction;sex determination;sex difference;sex differentiation;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Chromosomes, Human, X;X Chromosome",,

Furthermore, the process of X chromosome inactivation is altered in IVF and cloned porcine embryos, possibly explaining problems of embryo survival with these techniques. The aim of this study was to gain more insights into the transcriptional dynamics of the porcine pre-implantation embryo, with a particular focus on sex-specific differences. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed for individual blastocysts at 8, 10, and 12 days after ovulation, and the temporal development of sexspecific transcripts was analysed. German Landrace sows were cycle synchronized and inseminated with sperm of the same Pietrain boar. On Days 8, 10, and 12 post-insemination, sows were slaughtered and embryos were removed from the uterus using 10mL of PBS (pH 7.4) per horn.

Homozygosity leads to extremely low fertility and reveals two previously unknown non-mendelian patterns of inheritance. First, the sex ratio is skewed against female births so that one daughter is born for every two to three sons. Second, the pattern of XCI unexpectedly returns to random in surviving X(Delta)X(Delta) mice. Thus, with respect to choice, mutation of Tsix yields a phenotypic abnormality in heterozygotes but not homozygotes.

Female embryos produced more IFN-tau than males by 24 hr (mean values, males: 16.6 +/- 3.7, females: 49.4 +/- 9.0 pg per embryo; P < 0.05) and 48 hr (male: 189.8 +/- 37, 1, female: 410.9 +/- 66.6 pg per embryo; P<0.05). However, the variability in IFN-tau production between individual blastocysts was so great that IFN-tau secretion is unlikely to be of value as a non-invasive means to predict embryo sex. When conceptuses were recovered at day 14, elongating males (n = 25) and females (n = 24) were similar in dimension and did not differ in their IFN-tau production after 4.5 hr (male: 2,550 +/- 607, female: 2,376 +/- 772 ng per conceptus) and 24 hr (male: 12,056 +/- 2,438, female: 8,447 +/- 1,630 ng per conceptus) of culture. Thus, sexual dimorphism in IFN-tau production is observed in both IVP and in vivo-produced expanded blastocysts, but is lost by day 14 of in vivo development.

There was considerable heterogeneity in STS activity between inbred mouse strains, with a four fold difference in activity between the highest (101/H) and lowest (Ju/Ct) activity strains, which can be interpreted in terms of allelic differences. In all inbred strains male STS levels were higher than those of female STS levels and in the majority of strains tested male STS levels were nearly twice as high as female levels. Reciprocal crosses between C3H/HeH and the STS-deficient substrain, C3H/An, demonstrated that activities of the X- and Y-borne genes in males are essentially the same and this suggested that the lower STS level in females derives from X-inactivation of the locus. The possibility that hormonal differences could instead be responsible for the lower activity in females was ruled out by the findings that (a) castration of males did not reduce their STS levels and (b) sex-reversed males, X/X Sxr, had STS levels typical of females. Final proof that the mouse Sts locus can be subject to the X-inactivation process was provided by the observation that XX females had STS levels that were only slightly (20%) higher than those of XO females. The difference may indicate incomplete inactivation of the locus.

This depends on preferential survival of male embryos under conditions of high energy intake. In several species, growth factors including insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 have been shown to promote embryonic development by decreasing apoptosis and increasing cell proliferation. We hypothesized that sex-related differences in IGF-1 expression in equine embryos during the phase of maternal recognition of pregnancy might exist and thus contribute to preferential survival of embryos from either of both sexes under specific environmental conditions. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression of in vivo-produced equine embryos on different days of pregnancy (Day 8, N = 6; Day 10, N = 8; Day 12, N = 14) was analyzed. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression was evaluated by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The sex of the embryo was determined by detection of X-inactivation specific transcript (Xist) RNA and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome DNA. Embryos positive for Xist expression were classified as female, and Xist negative and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome positive embryos were classified as male. From 28 embryos tested, 15 (54%) showed positive Xist expression and were thus classified as female. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression was influenced by sex (P = 0.01) but not by day of pregnancy (relative expression of IGF-1 in relation to beta-actin, Day 8: male 5.1 +/- 2.1, female 11.4; Day 10: male 5.2 +/- 1.6, female 17.4 +/- 6.7; Day 12: male 2.6 +/- 0.3, female 11.6 +/- 2.4). Results demonstrate an increased expression of IGF-1 in female equine embryos. Sex-related influences on expression of the IGF system are probably related to a gradual X chromosome inactivation.

Organs were processed for histological evaluation of gonadal status. Briefly, male as well as female reproductive organs were developed physiologically. Spermatogenesis was found to be qualitatively normal but quantitatively substantially reduced. The ovary presented follicle-like structures. For determination of the chromosomal sex, X-inactivation was assessed by Xist expression. Xist expression was found to be negative, suggesting an XY karyotype for the gynandromorphic mouse. Gynandromorphism is an overall extremely rare finding mostly observed in insects, spiders, crustaceans, other arthropods, and birds. Bilateral gynandromorphism further specifies a midline seperation of male vs female characteristics, as observed for the internal genitalia in the mouse presented here. We suggest that the loss of the Y-chromosom in one cell of an XY two-cell stage, consequently leading to XY i.e. male and X0 i.e. female cell progeny during cell division, might offer a possible explanation for the bilateral development of functional reproductive organs of both XY and X0 origin in the present gynandromorphic mouse..",L638582808 2022-08-02,10.1177/00236772221103950,"adult;animal experiment;arthropod;bird;cell division;conference abstract;Crustacea;epididymis;Fallopian tube;female;female genital system;histology;insect;karyotype 46,XY;male;mouse;nonhuman;ovary follicle;penis;sexual characteristics;spermatogenesis;spider;testis;uterus horn;vagina;vas deferens;X chromosome inactivation;Mice",,

Consistent with the previous studies showing that CpG island-containing promoters of genes subject to XCI are approximately 50% methylated in females and unmethylated in males while genes which escape XCI are unmethylated in both sexes; our chromosome-wide (Methylated DNA ImmunoPrecipitation) and promoter-targeted methylation analyses (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 array) showed the largest methylation difference (D = 0.12, p < 2.2 E-16) between male and female blood at X-linked CpG islands promoters. We used the methylation differences between males and females to predict XCI statuses in blood and found that 81% had the same XCI status as previously determined using expression data. Most genes (83%) showed the same XCI status across tissues (blood, fetal: muscle, kidney and nerual); however, the methylation of a subset of genes predicted different XCI statuses in different tissues. Using previously published expression data the effect of transcription on gene-body methylation was investigated and while X-linked introns of highly expressed genes were more methylated than the introns of lowly expressed genes, exonic methylation did not differ based on expression level. We conclude that the XCI status predicted using methylation of X-linked promoters with CpG islands was usually the same as determined by expression analysis and that 12% of X-linked genes examined show tissue-specific XCI whereby a gene has a different XCI status in at least one of the four tissues examined. © 2011 The Author(s).",L51434578 2011-05-23 2011-08-12,10.1007/s00439-011-1007-8,article;autosome;brain tissue;CpG island;density;DNA methylation;exon;female;fetus (anatomy);gene expression;genetic transcription;human;human cell;human tissue;intron;kidney parenchyma;major clinical study;male;muscle tissue;nervous tissue;peripheral blood mononuclear cell;priority journal;sex difference;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Organ Specificity;Methylation,,

To date, however, no analogous system has been found for the study of clonality in tissue from men. In the current study, the methylation patterns for portions of the amelogenin genes are tested, which are encoded on both the X- and Y-chromosome (AMGX and AMGY). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify portions of AMGX and AMGY from genomic DNA of carcinomas of the colon, lung, liver and kidney, as well as from matched normal somatic tissues. The amplification target included Alu I methylation sensitive restriction endonuclease sites as well as a 189 bp sequence which is present in AMGX but is absent in AMGY. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of AMGX and AMGY was successful using genomic DNA from both tumour and normal control tissue in 24 of the 26 cases. Pretreatment of genomic DNA with Alu I blocked amplification of AMGX in all cases from both normal tissue and tumour. This indicates that AMGX and AMGY undergo a non-random pattern of methylation in both normal tissues and in tumours, precluding their use as a marker of clonality. Methylation of Alu I sites in AMGY suggests that the amelogenin genes undergo dosage compensation, which raises the possibility that the expression of amelogenin is not restricted to the development of the tooth bud but may also play some other role in various tissues of the body.","Zvejnieks, P A Tellschow, S R Gudlaugsson, E G Markham, N Shroyer, K R 1 R55 CA60830-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

The role of the second X chromosome in the female sex is less clear. Many, possibly most, genes on the second X chromosome are inactivated by the lyonization mechanism. It is obvious, however, that part of the second X chromosome escapes complete inactivation at least during certain periods or in certain cells. Otherwise, there would be no difference between XO females and XX females or between XY males and XXY males. The origin of the ovary is independent from the second X. Ovaries develop at the same time both in normal XX females and in XO females. In the latter, however, ovarian degeneration begins towards the end of pregnancy. There are conspicuous effects of the second X on survival, growth and form. Less than 5% of XO embryos will survive to term. Those surviving are small for date babies with severely retarded postnatal growth and increased postnatal mortality. Neither a comparably high mortality nor growth retardation are seen in the autosomal recessive or possible X linked types of pure gonadal dysgenesis. They must, therefore, in some way be related to the lack of the second X. The better chances of survival of normal females as compared to males may in part be due to a similar mechanism. X linked recessive genes, though present in about twice as many males, are regularly manifested in males, but only exceptionally in females. This mechanism causes a higher mortality of some males rather than a generally higher mortality of the male.

It is unclear whether this increase is attributable to secular trends in biological susceptibility, or to a change in diagnostic practices and recognition. One hint concerning etiological influences is the universally reported male excess (in the range of 4:1 to 10:1). Evidence suggests that genetic influences from the X chromosome play a crucial role in engendering this male vulnerability. In this review, we discuss three categories of genetic disease that highlight the importance of X-linked genes in the manifestation of an autistic phenotype: aneuploides (Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome), trinucleotide expansions (Fragile X syndrome) and nucleotide mutations (Rett Syndrome, Neuroligins 3 & 4, and SLC6A8). The lessons from these diseases include an understanding of autistic features as a broad phenotype rather than as a single clinical entity, the role of multiple genes either alone or in concert with the manifestation of autistic features, and the role of epigenetic factors such as imprinting and X-inactivation in the expression of disease severity. Better understanding of the clinical phenotypes of social cognition and the molecular neurogenetics of X-linked gene disorders will certainly provide additional tools for understanding autism in the years to come.",L358947578 2010-06-11,10.1093/scan/nsl028,"MECP2 protein, human;methyl CpG binding protein 2;autism;child;cognitive defect;female;genetics;genotype;human;male;phenotype;point mutation;preschool child;psychomotor disorder;review;sex chromosome;sex difference;syndrome;X chromosome;X Chromosome;Autistic Disorder",,

After mass excision and isolation of plasmid DNA, approximately 4800 expressed sequence tags were determined and compared to existing databases. Few cDNAs were specifically expressed in the urogenital ridge, but one, designated GPBOX, encodes a 227-amino-acid homeobox protein that is first expressed at E10.5 in the embryo as well as in the extraembryonic tissues. The Gpbox gene is single copy in the mouse genome and is located on the X chromosome in close proximity to two other homeobox genes, Pem and Psx1. Within the embryo, its expression is limited to the gonad, and transcripts are not detected in adult tissues. Although comparable levels are initially present in both sexes, GPBOX transcripts accumulate faster in female germ cells and peak at E12.5 when they are present in fivefold greater abundance than in males. The persistence of GPBOX transcripts in female germ cells until E15.5 and their virtual disappearance in males by E13.5 suggest that Gpbox may play a role in mammalian oogenesis.

As other hereditary X-linked disorders, females have historically been considered non-affected carriers, although they are, actually, clinically and pathologically affected to a variable degree. Some women are asymptomatic, but the majority present milder forms of the disease and later onset. This wide range of disease expression is supposed to be related to the levels of enzymatic activity, probably in accordance with a skewing of X inactivation. Lysosomal deposits of ceramide trihexoside have been repeatedly documented in a wide range of tissues, including those found in angiokeratoma, the characteristic cutaneous lesion which allowed the definition of Fabry disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was any difference in the amount of dermal lysosomal storage in males and females, thus accounting for the difference in clinical severity of both groups. For that purpose, with electron microscopy and quantitative methods, we studied the extent of lysosomal deposits in dermal fibroblasts of normal-appearing skin in six females and nine men, enzymatically and genetically proven as to have Fabry disease, and results were compared. Our results indicate a statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding both the percentage of dermal fibroblasts bearing stored material, and the storage surface occupied in 100 fibroblasts per case. We suggest that periodical ultrastructural examination of normal-appearing skin could be an indicator of the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy and could help to evaluate results. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",L43640302 2006-05-25,10.1007/s00401-005-0026-8,alpha galactosidase;ceramide trihexoside;adolescent;adult;article;chromosome inactivation;clinical article;controlled study;disease course;disease severity;electron microscopy;enzyme activity;enzyme replacement;Fabry disease;female;hemangiokeratoma;hemizygosity;heterozygosity;human;lysosome;lysosome storage disease;male;priority journal;quantitative analysis;sex difference;skin examination;skin fibroblast;skin manifestation;skin structure;statistical significance;symptomatology;ultrastructure;X chromosome linked disorder;Fabry Disease,,

Forty two affected males and 61 females were examined, and from the data obtained the following conclusions were drawn: X linked retinitis pigmentosa exists and is distinct from choroideremia. In contrast to the results of previous surveys, X linked retinitis pigmentosa is a common form of this disease and over 20% of retinitis pigmentosa is probably transmitted in an X linked manner. In contradistinction to the findings of previous investigators, most if not all adult heterozygous females have detectable degenerative changes in the ocular fundus. The ocular changes in heterozygous females are most easily detected by fundus examination, visual field testing, dark adaptation measurements, and estimation of retinal rhodopsin concentration. The single most frequent abnormality is peripheral retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, which is found in all adult heterozygous females. The pattern of retinal dysfunction in heterozygous females, and in particular preservation of the ocular electrical response suggests that the disease in women is qualitatively different from that in men and in other genetic forms of retinitis pigmentosa. There is some evidence that the disease in heterozygous women is patchy. Degeneration in heterozygous females in usually symmetrical, but great variation was found in the severity of degeneration amongst heterozygotes of similar ages. No nonkinetic influences were found to account for this. No evidence came to light by which the importance of X chromosome inactivation could be assessed in determining the phenotype of heterozygous women.

V. and Hahn, M. W.",,,,,"Theoretical studies predict X chromosomes and autosomes should be under different selection pressures, and there should therefore be differences in sex-specific and sexually antagonistic gene content between the X and the autosomes. Previous analyses have identified an excess of genes duplicated by retrotransposition from the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster. A number of hypotheses may explain this pattern, including mutational bias, escape from X-inactivation during spermatogenesis, and the movement of male-favored (sexually antagonistic) genes from a chromosome that is predominantly carried by females. To distinguish among these processes and to examine the generality of these patterns, we identified duplicated genes in nine sequenced Drosophila genomes. We find that, as in D. melanogaster, there is an excess of genes duplicated from the X chromosome across the genus Drosophila. This excess duplication is due almost completely to genes duplicated by retrotransposition, with little to no excess from the X among genes duplicated via DNA intermediates. The only exception to this pattern appears within the burst of duplication that followed the creation of the Drosophila pseudoobscura neo-X chromosome. Additionally, we examined genes relocated among chromosomal arms (i.e., genes duplicated to new locations coupled with the loss of the copy in the ancestral locus) and found an excess of genes relocated off the ancestral X and neo-X chromosomes. Interestingly, many of the same genes were duplicated or relocated from the independently derived neo-X chromosomes of D. pseudoobscura and Drosophila willistoni, suggesting that natural selection favors the traffic of genes from X chromosomes. Overall, we find that the forces driving gene duplication from X chromosomes are dependent on the lineage in question, the molecular mechanism of duplication considered, the preservation of the ancestral copy, and the age of the X chromosome.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 54 Total Times Cited: 55 Cited Reference Count: 44,10.1093/gbe/evp018,gene duplication;retrotransposition;sex chromosomes;neo-X chromosomes;X-inactivation;EVOLUTION;PSEUDOOBSCURA;INACTIVATION;MELANOGASTER;DUPLICATION;EXPRESSION;RETROGENE;MOVEMENT;X Chromosome,,

The disorder is characterised by physiological abnormalities (notably short stature and ovarian dysfunction), emotional anomalies (including heightened anxiety) and by a neuropsychological profile encompassing deficits in visuospatial skills, memory, attention, social cognition and emotion recognition. Moreover, TS subjects are at significantly increased risk of developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. At the neuroanatomical level, TS subjects display abnormalities across a number of brain structures, including the amygdala, hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex. The TS phenotype arises due to reduced dosage of X-linked genes, and may also be modulated by parental origin of the single X chromosome. In this review, we discuss the utility of a mouse model of TS, the 39,XO mouse, in which the parental origin of the single X chromosome can be varied. This model provides the opportunity to investigate the effects of X-linked gene dosage/parent-of-origin effects on neurobiology in the absence of gross physiological abnormalities. Initial findings indicate that several features of the TS behavioural phenotype may be accurately recapitulated in the mouse. Furthermore, as X-linked gene dosage/imprinting can influence sex-specific neurobiology, investigations in the 39,XO mouse are also likely to offer insights into why certain neuropsychiatric disorders (including ADHD and autism) affect the sexes differently. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, recent evidence indicates that reduced MeCP2 expression or activity is also found in autism and other disorders with overlapping phenotypes. Considering the sex difference in autism diagnosis, with males diagnosed four times more often than females, we questioned if a sex difference existed in the expression of MeCP2, in particular within the amygdala, a region that develops atypically in autism. We found that male rats express significantly less mecp2 mRNA and protein than females within the amygdala, as well as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), but not within the preoptic area (POA) on post-natal day 1 (PN1). At PN10 these differences were gone; however, on this day males had more mecp2 mRNA than females within the POA. The transient sex difference of mecp2 expression during the steroid-sensitive period of brain development suggests that mecp2 may participate in normal sexual differentiation of the rat brain.

These disorders are mainly seen in male individuals, but a few affected females have been described. More than 400 different mutations have been identified in the ATP7A gene. We have conducted several studies in the hope of uncovering the relationship between genotype and phenotype. We have examined the X-inactivation pattern in affected females, the effect of exon-deletions and-duplications, and splice-site mutations on the composition and amount of ATP7A transcript, and we have examined the structural location of missense mutations. The X-inactivation pattern did not fully explain the manifestation of MD in a small fraction of carriers. Most of the affected females had preferential inactivation of the X-chromosome with the normal ATP7A gene, but a few individuals exhibited preferential inactivation of the X-chromosome with the mutated ATP7A gene. The observed mild phenotype in some patients with mutations that effect the composition of the ATP7A transcript, seems to be explained by the presence of a small amount of normal ATP7A transcript. The location of missense mutations on structural models of the ATP7A protein suggests that affected conserved residues generally lead to a severe phenotype. The ATP7A protein traffics within the cells. At low copper levels, ATP7A locates to the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) to load cuproenzymes with copper, whereas at higher concentrations, ATP7A shifts to the post-Golgi compartments or to the plasma membrane to export copper out of the cell. Impaired copper-regulation trafficking has been observed for ATP7A mutants, but its impact on the clinical outcome is not clear. The major problem in patients with MD seems to be insufficient amounts of copper in the brain. In fact, prenatal treatment of mottled mice as a model for human MD with a combination of chelator and copper, produces a slight increase in copper levels in the brain which perhaps leads to longer survival and more active behavior. In conclusion, small amounts of copper at the right location seem to relieve the symptoms.",L604484039 2015-05-28 2015-06-18,10.1016/j.jtemb.2014.07.022,"adenosine triphosphatase;ATP7A protein, human;cation transport protein;chelating agent;copper;drug therapy;Menkes protein;animal;article;ATP7A gene;brain;clinical feature;cutis laxa;deficiency;nutritional deficiency;diet supplementation;diet therapy;down regulation;Ehlers Danlos syndrome;etiology;exon;female;gene deletion;gene duplication;gene identification;gene location;gene mutation;genetic association;genetic conservation;X chromosome linked disorder;genetic transcription;genetic variability;genetics;hereditary motor sensory neuropathy;heterozygote;human;male;Menkes syndrome;metabolism;missense mutation;mutation;nerve cell;nonhuman;pathophysiology;phenotype;priority journal;severity of illness index;sex difference;symptomatology;therapy;trans Golgi network;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Phenotype",,

This Y* mouse line is used by several laboratories to study two human aneuploid conditions: Turner and Klinefelter syndromes.

We compared gene expression differences between gonadal males and females as well as individuals with one vs. two X-chromosomes.

Additionally there is likely more than one pectus disease-associated allele, as well as a relatively large number of disease allele carriers in the human population. Some clinical traits appear important and may serve as reliable indicators for predicting the likelihood of pectus excavatum in children before severe symptoms present. Quantifying sex-ratio bias in probands demonstrates a highly significant male bias associated with pectus excavatum.

Environmental conditions that are experienced in early life can profoundly influence human biology and long-term health. Developmental origins of health and disease and life-history transitions are purported to use placental, nutritional, and endocrine cues for setting long-term biological, mental, and behavioral strategies in response to local ecological and/or social conditions. The window of developmental plasticity extends from preconception to early childhood and involves epigenetic responses to environmental changes, which exert their effects during life-history phase transitions.

None of them, however, takes sex into account, indeed, some previous meta-analyses identified Y chromosome genes as differentially expressed in PE. We hypothesized that failure to account for feto-placental sex could lead to incorrect conclusions from such studies. METHODS: We developed a method to identify the sex of samples from published PE microarray studies. We compared standard meta-analysis of these studies and an approach where sex was taken into account. Finally, we compared the placental transcriptome associated with PE separately for males and females. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies were publically available, but only 8 met our inclusion criteria. Sample sex was identified in 6 of those. While cases were quite well balanced: 33/70 (47%) were male, there was a sex bias in controls: 37/96 (38%) were female (c2 test: P=0.094). Using a standard meta-analysis (not sex corrected), we found apparent differential regulation (FDR<5x10-5) of genes in PE which included 8 Y chromosome genes (CD24P4, DDX3Y, EIF1AY, EIF4A1P2, KDM5D, RPS4Y1, UTY & USP9Y) and 3 X chromosome genes known to escape X inactivation (XIST, STS and FHL1). 91% and 96% of up- and down-regulated genes respectively, remained significant when gender was accounted for, but all but two Y chromosome pseudogenes and all X chromosome genes lost their significance when gender was taken into account. When we performed meta-analysis stratified by fetal sex, PE datasets showed different placental molecular profiles for males and females. Of the 500 most significantly up-regulated genes in the two groups, only 54% overlapped between males and females. The equivalent figure for downregulated genes was 48%. Over 20% of the non-overlapping up- and down-regulated genes showed a male to female rank difference >1,000 and two genes had a rank difference of >10,000: CRHR1-IT1 (ranked 205 in males and 16,280 in females) and C2orf88 (ranked 380 in males and 11,022 in females). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Feto-placental sex is an important factor that should be taken into account when performing integrative analysis of microarray data, and biases could also arise from failure to match for other demographic and obstetric characteristics; (2) male and female PE have a different molecular profile; (3) well-designed, large scale, one-platform or RNA-seq study could address these issues.",L615323195 2017-04-17,10.1177/1933719117699773,CD24 antigen;corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1;endogenous compound;initiation factor 4A;transcriptome;adverse drug reaction;controlled study;DNA microarray;DNA transcription;female;fetus;gender;gene expression;gene inactivation;human;human tissue;male;meta analysis;placenta;population based case control study;preeclampsia;pseudogene;side effect;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;Transcriptome;Eclampsia;Pre-Eclampsia,,

In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial. Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses. We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs, monocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men. Female B cells where TLR7 is thus biallelically expressed display higher TLR7-driven functional responses, connecting the presence of two X chromosomes with the enhanced immunity of women and their increased susceptibility to TLR7-dependent autoimmune syndromes.",L624184692 2018-10-11 2019-02-19,10.1007/s00281-018-0712-y,CD40 ligand;chemokine receptor CXCR3;estradiol;estrogen;estrogen receptor alpha;messenger RNA;toll like receptor 7;toll like receptor 8;transcription factor FOXP3;antibody production;autoimmune disease;B lymphocyte;cytokine production;disease predisposition;female;gene dosage;genetic risk;genetic susceptibility;human;immune evasion;Klinefelter syndrome;monocyte;nonhuman;pathogenesis;plasmacytoid dendritic cell;priority journal;review;sex difference;systemic lupus erythematosus;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome;Gene Dosage,,

Autoimmune attacks on self tissues can occur in any organ or body system. A notable feature of autoimmune disease is that a majority of these disorders occur predominantly in females. The precise basis of sex bias in autoimmune diseases is complex and potentially involves sex chromosomes, sex hormones, and sex-specific gene regulation in response to internal and external stimuli. Epigenetic regulation of genes, especially by microRNAs (miRNAs), is now attracting significant attention. miRNAs are small, non-protein-coding RNAs that are predicted to regulate a majority of human genes, including those involved in immune regulation. Therefore, it is not surprising that dysregulated miRNAs are evident in many diseases, including autoimmune diseases. Because there are marked sex differences in the incidence of autoimmune diseases, this review focuses on the role of sex factors on miRNA expression in the context of autoimmune diseases, an aspect not addressed thus far. Here, we initially review miRNA biogenesis and miRNA regulation of immunity and autoimmunity. We then summarize the recent findings of sexual dimorphism of miRNA expression in diverse tissues, which imply a critical role of miRNA in sex differentiation and in sex-specific regulation of tissue development and/or function. We also discuss the important contribution of the X chromosome and sex hormones to the sexual dimorphism of miRNA expression. Understanding sexually dimorphic miRNA expression in sex-biased autoimmune diseases not only offers us new insight into the mechanism of sex bias of the disease but will also aid us in developing new sex-based therapeutic strategies for the efficient treatment of these diseases with a sex bias. © 2014 Dai and Ahmed.",L372662228 2014-04-01 2014-04-09,10.2147/tcrm.S33517,androgen;argonaute 2 protein;CD40 ligand;cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B;cytochrome P450 2B9;dicer;DNA directed RNA polymerase III;estrogen;estrogen receptor alpha;exportin 5;interleukin 10;microRNA;microRNA 127;microRNA 155;microRNA 182;microRNA 221;microRNA 222;microRNA 223;microRNA 23a;microRNA 31;microRNA 379;microRNA 98;ribonuclease III;RNA polymerase II;RNase III enzyme Drosha;single stranded RNA;toll like receptor 7;unclassified drug;X chromosome linked microRNA;X linked inhibitor of apoptosis;3' untranslated region;autoimmune disease;autoimmunity;biogenesis;cause of death;CD4+ T lymphocyte;cellular distribution;disease predisposition;disease severity;epigenetics;gender bias;gene;gene expression;gene expression regulation;gene function;gene location;gene targeting;genetic predisposition;genetic transcription;gonad development;gonad function;hormonal regulation;human;immune response;immunocompetent cell;immunological tolerance;immunoregulation;mirtron;molecular recognition;nonhuman;pathophysiology;regulatory T lymphocyte;review;RNA structure;sex determination;sex difference;sex differentiation;sex ratio;signal transduction;systemic lupus erythematosus;tissue distribution;X chromosome inactivation;XIAP gene;Y chromosome;Autoimmune Diseases;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Size and gene content of Xq22-PLP1-DEL vary and were proposed as potential molecular etiologies underlying variable expressivity in carrier females where two smallest regions of overlap (SROs) were suggested to influence disease. We ascertained a cohort of eight unrelated patients harboring Xq22-PLP1-DEL and performed high-density array comparative genomic hybridization and breakpoint-junction sequencing. Molecular characterization of Xq22-PLP1-DEL from 17 cases (eight herein and nine published) revealed an overrepresentation of breakpoints that reside within repeats (11/17, ~65%) and the clustering of ~47% of proximal breakpoints in a genomic instability hotspot with characteristic non-B DNA density. These findings implicate a potential role for genomic architecture in stimulating the formation of Xq22-PLP1-DEL. The correlation of Xq22-PLP1-DEL gene content with neurological disease trait in female cases enabled refinement of the associated SROs to a single genomic interval containing six genes.

The GGAZ painted the Z chromosomes in all species analyzed, suggesting strong conservation of its gene content among the different avian lineages. This was confirmed by the mapping of five GGAZ-orthologous genes (DMRT1, GHR, CHRNB3, ALDOB, B4GALT1) to the Z chromosomes of eight other species. The shuffled order of these genes on different Z chromosomes can be explained by the prevalence of intrachromosomal rearrangements during avian evolution. Synteny conservation of the mammalian X is generally thought to be the result of X chromosome inactivation. The absence of Z chromosome inactivation implies sex-specific dosage differences of a highly conserved array of Z-linked genes in birds. The evolutionary conservation of the entire Z chromosome among avian lineages supports the idea that avian sex determination and/or sex-specific functions are largely based on sex chromosome dosage. We propose that the accumulation of male-specific genes on the Z chromosome confers selective pressure on the Z to conserve its synteny. Copyright © 2008 S.

We identified 159 parents with psychoses (schizophrenia psychosis spectrum disorders (SPS, n = 59) and affective (AP, n = 100)) and 114 comparable, healthy control parents. 203 high risk (HR) and 147 control offspring were diagnostically assessed (185 females; 165 males). We compared the proportion of male:female offspring with psychoses by affected parent sex and the consistency for SPS compared to AP parents, and tested (using exact logistic regression) whether the male:female ratio for affected offspring differed significantly between affected mothers and affected fathers. Risk of psychosis in offspring was a function of the sex of the parent and offspring. Among ill mothers, 18.8% of their male offspring developed psychosis compared with 9.5% of their daughters. In contrast, among ill fathers, 3.1% of their male offspring developed psychosis compared with 15.2% of their daughters. The male:female ratio for affected offspring differed significantly (p < 0.05) between affected mothers and fathers. Similar patterns held for SPS and AP.

In mammals, the extent of the birth sex bias is often unpredictable and inconsistent, leading some to question its evolutionary significance. For facultative adjustment of sex ratios to occur, males and females would need to be detectably different from an early developmental stage, but classic sexual dimorphism arises from hormonal influences after gonadal development. Recent advances in our understanding of early, pregonadal sexual dimorphism, however, indicate high levels of dimorphism in gene expression, caused by chromosomal rather than hormonal differences. Here, we discuss how such dimorphism would interact with and link previously hypothesized mechanisms for sex-ratio adjustment. These differences between males and females are sufficient for offspring sex both to be detectable to parents and to provide selectable cues for biasing sex ratios from the earliest stages. We suggest ways in which future research could use the advances in our understanding of sexually dimorphic developmental physiology to test the evolutionary significance of sex allocation in mammals.

This technique was used to quantify the level of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) expression during preimplantation development and to correlate this with embryo sex. The amount of HPRT transcripts present in the unfertilized oocyte was equivalent to 7.7 fg of competitor cDNA. At the 4-cell stage there is a significant drop (P = 0.0006) to ∼1.2 fg.

By Northern blot analysis, we found Eif2s3x to be expressed higher in females than in males in developing and adult brains as well as adult liver. Gonadally intact XX mice had a higher level of Eif2s3x mRNA expression than XY mice regardless of whether they had testes or ovaries, suggesting that sexually dimorphic gene expression arises as a consequence of sex chromosome complement. In situ hybridization indicated that Eif2s3x mRNA was expressed preferentially in specific brain regions including the habenula, anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. Females had significantly higher levels of Eif2s3x mRNA expression than males in cortex, hippocampus and paraventricular nucleus but not in the habenula. The effect of a sex difference in Eif2s3x transcription, however, could potentially be offset by the additional expression in male brains of its Y-linked homologue Eif2s3y which was found in similar brain regions. The sex difference in Eif2s3x transcript appears not to be preserved at the protein level, since no difference in the levels of Eif2s3 protein was found between (1) males and females (2) XX and XY mice, or (3) XO and XX females. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This review explores the current status of epidemiological, genetic, and neuroendocrinological work addressing ASD prevalence and liability in males and females, so as to frame the major issues necessary to pursue a more complete understanding of the biological basis for sex-differential risk. Purpose of Review: Recent studies continue to report a male bias in ASD prevalence, but also suggest that sex differences in phenotypic presentation, including fewer restricted and repetitive behaviors and externalizing behavioral problems in females, may contribute to this bias. Genetic studies demonstrate that females are protected from the effects of heritable and de-novo ASD risk variants, and compelling work suggests that sex chromosomal genes and/or sex hormones, especially testosterone, may modulate the effects of genetic variation on the presentation of an autistic phenotype. Summary: ASDs affect females less frequently than males, and several sex-differential genetic and hormonal factors may contribute. Future work to determine the mechanisms by which these factors confer risk and protection to males and females is essential. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",L52443665 2013-02-20 2013-03-21,10.1097/WCO.0b013e32835ee548,"retinoid related orphan receptor alpha;ryanodine receptor 2;testosterone;uridine phosphorylase;autism;chromosome deletion;copy number variation;genetic risk;genetic variability;human;hyperandrogenism;Klinefelter syndrome;phenotype;prevalence;review;sex chromosome;sex difference;single nucleotide polymorphism;trisomy;Turner syndrome;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Child Development Disorders, Pervasive;Autistic Disorder;Sex Characteristics",,

R.",,,,,"Mammals compensate for sex differences in the number of X chromosomes by inactivating all but one X chromosome. Although they differ in the details of X inactivation, all mammals use long non-coding RNAs in the silencing process. By transcribing XIST RNA, the human inactive X chromosome has a prime role in X-dosage compensation. Yet, the autosomes also play an important role in the process. Multiple genes on human chromosome 1 interact with XIST RNA to silence the future inactive Xs. Also, it is likely that multiple genes on human chromosome 19 prevent the silencing of the single active X - a highly dosage sensitive process. Previous studies of the organization of chromosomes in the nucleus and their genomic interactions indicate that most contacts are intra-chromosomal. Co-ordinate transcription and dosage regulation can be achieved by clustering of genes and mingling of interacting chromosomes in 3D space. Unlike the genes on chromosome 1, those within the critical eight MB region of chromosome 19, have remained together in all mammals assayed, except rodents, indicating that their proximity in non-rodent mammals is evolutionarily conserved. I propose that the autosomal genes that play key roles in the process of X inactivation are non-randomly distributed in the genome and that this arrangement facilitates their coordinate regulation.","2296-634x Migeon, Barbara R Journal Article Switzerland 2019/09/27 Front Cell Dev Biol. 2019 Aug 6;7:144. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2019.00144. eCollection 2019.",10.3389/fcell.2019.00144,X-chromosome dosage compensation;autosomes in X inactivation;clustered gene interactions;evolutionary conservation;inter-chromosomal interaction;intra-chromosomal interaction;single active X,,

Importance of this complex and species-specific event has been highlighted recently in developmental and stem cell biology. However, the process has been confirmed only in restricted species, even though the species-specific studies are needed for comprehensive understanding of XCI in specific species. XCI is regulated by the various genes, many of which are coded on the X chromosome inactivation centre (XIC). Among the XIC-linked genes, especially non-coding RNA (ncRNA) like XIST, which is master gene for XCI, are known to regulate XIC. But the centre is not identified in various species. In this study, we identified XIC in pig and analysed the dosage differences of XIC-linked gene in porcine embryos. At first, the centre was searched in pig. The genomic length of the porcine XIC was similar to human XIC and the order and coding strand of the counterparts in pig XIC were same as the human XIC-linked genes. However, sequence comparison between human XIC-linked gene and its porcine counterpart showed that ncRNA around XIST were less conserved rather than protein-coding genes. This would be caused by rapid evolution of genomic region harboring ncRNA. The expression of XIC-linked genes was compared between male and female porcine embryonic fibroblast (PEF) to confirm that dosage compensation is completed in PEF. Most of the genes were not expressed sex-specifically, but two genes, XIST and an uncharacterized gene, LOC102165544, were expressed female preferentially in PEF. Interestingly, LOC102165544, which had low sequence homology with human JPX, was expressed about 2-fold higher in female PEF. This means that XIST and LOC102165544 are XCI-escaping genes. Among the XIC-linked genes, CHIC1, XIST, LOC102165544, and RLIM were stably expressed in embryonic stage, and XIST and LOC102165544 were up-regulated after morula formation. As XIST accumulation is a requisite for XCI initiation, expression levels of the 4 genes between male and female blastocysts were compared. Interestingly, expression levels of CHIC1 and RLIM were not different in male and female blastocysts. This means their dosage would be already compensated in porcine blastocyst. Additionally, to confirm loci of the 2 genes CHIC1 and RLIM harbor one of the inactive alleles in female blastocyst, the DNA methylation pattern was examined. One of the CHIC1 alleles was inactive but RLIM CpG site was hypo-methylated in female blastocyst. This would indicate that one of the RLIM alleles is transcriptionally inactivated by chromatin modification rather than by DNA methylation of the allele. Regulatory regions of XIST and LOC102165544 were demethylated in blastocyst and this showed XCI was not finished in porcine blastocyst. Conclusively, our results demonstrate the XCI already occurs in porcine blastocyst at least one gene but it is not completed.",L71814637 2015-03-18,10.1071/RDv27n1abs,"untranslated RNA;protein;DNA;RNA;gene expression regulation;X chromosome inactivation;gene;blastocyst;embryo transfer;society;human;female;species;allele;male;pig;DNA methylation;chromatin;cytology;stem cell;morula;sequence homology;fibroblast;porcine embryo;placental mammal;X Chromosome;Dosage Compensation, Genetic",,

Progressive adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) that mainly affects girls is generally attributed to relative anterior spinal overgrowth from a mechanical mechanism (torsion) during the adolescent growth spurt. Established biological risk factors to AIS are growth velocity and potential residual spinal growth assessed by maturity indicators. Spine slenderness and ectomorphy in girls are thought to be risk factors for AIS. Claimed biomechanical susceptibilities are (1) a fixed lordotic area and hypokyphosis and (2) concave periapical rib overgrowth. MRI has revealed neuroanatomical abnormalities in ∼20% of younger children with IS. A neuromuscular cause for AIS is probable but not established. Possible susceptibilities to AIS in tissues relate to muscles, ligaments, discs, skeletal proportions and asymmetries, the latter also affecting soft tissues (e.g. dermatoglyphics). AIS is generally considered to be multi-factorial in origin. The many anomalies detected, particularly left-right asymmetries, have led to spatiotemporal aetiologic concepts involving chronomics and the genome altered by nurture without the necessity for a disease process. Genetic susceptibilities defined in twins are being evaluated in family studies; polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor gene are associated with curve severity. A neurodevelopmental concept is outlined for the aetiology of progressive AIS.

The frequency and the type of anomalies detected among 140 abortuses are in good agreement with those observed by others using conventional tissue cultures. Abnormal karyotypes were found in 48.6% of the cases. Trisomy predominated (66.2%), followed by polyploidy (22.1%), monosomy X (7.4%), and structural anomalies (4.4%). Among the trisomies, the most prevalent were of chromosome 22 (22.2%), 16 (22.2%), and 13 (9.5%). The relative frequencies of trisomies, monosomy X, and the different chromosomes involved in trisomies seem to differ between our study and those in which tissue cultures were analyzed. Our low frequency of 45,XO karyotypes and the shift to trisomies of chromosomes whose involvement increases steeply with maternal age are considered due to the approximately 3 year higher mean maternal age in our sample. The sex ratio (male to female) in chromosomally abnormal abortuses was 1.28, which is nearly identical to the 1.2 found in earlier studies. Suprisingly, in chromosomally normal abortions males were significantly outnumbered by females (sex ratio 0.76). Since maternal cell contamination cannot have influenced the sex ratio in our study, we consider it worthwhile to investigate whether failures associated with X inactivation are responsible for pregnancy wastage of some euploid female conceptuses.

Sex chromosomes are the most obvious genetic difference between males and females and thus may contribute to the sex differences in alcoholism. All female mammals (XX) balance gene expression with males (XY) by inactivating one of their X chromosomes (X chromosome inactivation, XCI) in a near equal or random fashion. Occasionally, XCI can be nonrandom or highly skewed (>80%:20%) and is found in females with X-linked genetic conditions such as X-linked mental retardation, Rett syndrome and autism. XCI can occur through preferential cell selection for X-linked genes in females or through insults in early embryonic development leading to cell death and a small pool of viable cells which can result in XCI skewness and overexpression of a particular X chromosome. To better understand the role of skewed XCI in complex diseases with known genetic factors such as alcoholism, we examined 23 adult females with Alcohol Use Disorder (20 blood samples, 3 cortical brain tissues) and 45 females with no known history of alcohol abuse served as controls (33 blood samples, 12 cortical brain tissues). XCI status was determined by analyzing the digested and undigested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA products of the polymorphic androgen receptor (AR) gene located on the long arm of the X chromosome. Subjects were characterized into three groups based upon the degree of XCI skewing: random (50:50- 64:36), moderately skewed (65:35-80:20) and highly skewed (>80:20). Informative data were obtained for 21 affected and 44 control females.

The comparable figures for control females were: 59%, 30% and 11%, respectively. The distribution of skewed XCI observed among women with alcoholism did not differ statistically from control females (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.41). In addition, no difference was seen in the XCI findings from blood versus brain tissue.

Our modern concepts of Mendelian (including X-linked) inheritance originated just after the turn of the last century. Early concepts of dominance and recessiveness were first used in conjunction with autosomal traits, and then applied to ""sex""-linked traits to distinguish X-linked recessive and X-linked dominant inheritance. The former was defined as vertical transmission in which carrier women pass the disorder to affected sons, while the latter was defined as vertical transmission in which daughters of affected males are always affected, transmitting the disorder to offspring of both sexes. However, many X-linked disorders such as adrenoleukodystrophy, fragile X syndrome, and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency do not fit these rules. We reviewed the literature on 32 X-linked disorders and recorded information on penetrance and expressivity in both sexes. As expected, penetrance and an index of severity of the phenotype (defined in our Methods) were both high in males, while the severity index was low in females. Contrary to standard presentations of X-linked inheritance, penetrance was highly variable in females. Our analysis classified penetrance as high in 28% of the disorders studied, intermediate in 31%, and low in 40%. The high proportion of X-linked disorders with intermediate penetrance is difficult to reconcile with standard definitions of X-linked recessive and dominant inheritance. They do not capture the extraordinarily variable expressivity of X-linked disorders or take into account the multiple mechanisms that can result in disease expression in females, which include cell autonomous expression, skewed X-inactivation, clonal expansion, and somatic mosaicism. We recommend that use of the terms X-linked recessive and dominant be discontinued, and that all such disorders be simply described as following ""X-linked"" inheritance. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",L39121279 2004-09-07,10.1002/ajmg.a.30123,ornithine carbamoyltransferase;adrenoleukodystrophy;article;chromosome mosaicism;clonal variation;disease course;disease severity;disorders of amino acid and protein metabolism;enzyme deficiency;female;fragile X syndrome;human;male;nomenclature;nonhuman;phenotypic variation;priority journal;sex difference;vertical transmission;X chromosomal inheritance;X chromosome inactivation;X chromosome linkage,,

The X-chromosome plays an important role in the development of the human brain and of human intelligence, containing about 30% of genes related with mental retardation. Furthermore, many X-chromosomal genes are known regulators of autosomal gene ex-methpression. Thus changes in X-inactivation not only influence expression of X-chromosomal genes, but also of autosomal genes. In humans about 20% of X-chromosomal genes outside the pseudoautosomal region escape X-inactivation in females, which are likely to play a role in neuronal differentiation, directly or by influencing other (autosomal) genes. So far, however, detailed research into this has only been possible in mice and with non-invasive methods in patients suffering from Turner syndrome. iPSCs are a promising tool for modelling gender differences during human brain development. We have successfully reprogrammed two different fibroblast cell lines of female carriers of MID1 frameshift mutations into iPSCs and could identify clones that either express MID1 from the mutated or the non-mutated X-chromosome. We planned to use these cells as isogenic controls and differentiate them into NPCs and neurons, to get a better understanding of Opitz BBB/G syndrome. Interestingly, while X-inactivation was stable in the iPSCs, we observed a re-activation upon differentiation into NPCs of the second MID1 allele, leading to a biallelic expression of MID1 in NPCs. When having a closer look at the different stages of the differentiation process, we found that the re-activation happened after FGF2 was added to the media. At the same time however we could show that other genes kept their inactivated status, which led us hypothesize that FGF2 causes a partial re-activation of the inactivated X-chromosome during neuronal differentiation, a mechanism that would allow fine-tuned up-regulation of selected genes in female brain. To get a better understanding of the underlying mechanism, we are currently further analyzing FGF2 effects on iPS cells and fibroblasts and study the expression pattern of over 100 X-chromosomal genes using QUASEP-assays and RNAseq.

The histological changes in the testes corresponded to spermatogenic arrest. Electron microscopic whole-mount spreadings of meiotic cells in the pachytene stage showed that in most nuclei an extra chromosome 21 was not detectable. Only in a small number of nuclei, univalents or trivalents with segmental pairing structures of an extra chromosome could be discovered. In contrast, the great majority of (C-banded) diakinesis figures showed the presence of a supernumerary G (no. 21) chromosome. The absence of a traceable extra chromosome 21 in most pachytene cells is explained by the assumption that it is intimately connected with and hidden in the sex vesicle, whose complex structure does not allow the identification of single elements. Strong support for this assumption is seen (a) in the general tendency of narrow spatial association of unpaired segments with the XY complex and (b) in close structural similarities occurring between univalents or nonsynapsed segments of trivalents and the nonpaired segments of the sex chromosomes. It is suggested that the association or connection of an extra chromosome with the XY complex during pachytene interferes with the phenomenon of X inactivation. In animal systems such abnormal interference is related with spermatogenic breakdown and, in a general way, with male hybrid type sterility. So far, the range of sterility vs. fertility in cases of male Down's syndrome is not yet fully clear, but it appears that impairment of fertility, and sterility are most frequent. If so, it is proposed that the effect of the trisomy 21 condition on spermatogenesis (and fertility) is a consequence of the behavior of the extra chromosome in the meiotic prophase.","Johannisson, R Gropp, A Winking, H Coerdt, W Rehder, H Schwinger, E Case Reports Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Germany 1983/01/01 Hum Genet. 1983;63(2):132-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00291532.",10.1007/bf00291532,"Adolescent;Adult;Biopsy;Chromosome Banding;Down Syndrome/genetics/*pathology;Female;Humans;Karyotyping;Male;Meiosis;Microscopy, Electron;Middle Aged;Sex Factors;Spermatocytes/cytology;Spermatogonia/cytology;Testis/*pathology/ultrastructure",,

We consider gender-related biological factors that (a) affect disease onset and progression, (b) gender differences for major X-linked ocular disorders, (c) gender-specific conditions, (d) medications that may influence genetic eye disorders, and finally, (e) gender-related issues that influence the management and quality of life of these patients. Several studies have demonstrated the manner in which sex-related hormones in animal models are capable of influencing cell pathway and survival that are likely to affect hereditary eye disorders. There are very few clinical studies that provide compelling evidence for gender differences in human ocular conditions, other than for a number of X-linked disorders. Disease expression for X-linked disorders may be impacted by genetic mechanisms such as lyonization or uniparental disomy. Clinical evidence regarding the impact of gender-related medical conditions and therapies on eye conditions is extremely limited and primarily based on anecdotal evidence. Gender-specific factors may play a major role in the underlying biological pathways that influence the onset, rate of progression, and clinical findings associated with ocular genetic conditions. Clinicians need to be aware of the variable phenotypes observed in female carriers of X-linked disorders of gender specific issues, many of which are inadequately addressed in the current literature. Clinicians need to be sensitive to gender differences in social, cultural, and religious systems and they should also be aware of how their own gender biases may influence how they counsel patients.

During development epigenetic reprograming takes place during gametogenesis and then again in the pre-implantation embryo. These two reprograming windows ensure genome-wide removal of methylation in the primordial germ cells so that sex-specific signatures can be acquired in the sperm and oocyte. Following fertilization the majority of this epigenetic information is erased to give the developing embryo an epigenetic profile coherent with pluripotency. It is estimated that ∼65% of the genome is differentially methylated between the gametes, however following embryonic reprogramming only parent-of-origin methylation at known imprinted loci remains. This suggests that trans-acting factors such as Zfp57 can discriminate imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from the thousands of CpG rich regions that are differentially marked in the gametes. Recently transient imprinted DMRs have been identified suggesting that these loci are also protected from pre-implantation reprograming but succumb to de novo remethylation at the implantation stage. This highlights that ""ubiquitous"" imprinted loci are also resilient to gaining methylation by protecting their unmethylated alleles. In this review I examine the processes involved in epigenetic reprograming and the mechanisms that ensure allelic methylation at imprinted loci is retained throughout the life of the organism, discussing the critical differences between mouse and humans.

The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of in vitro production (IVP) and nuclear transfer (NT) on the relative abundance (RA) of the X-linked transcripts G6PD, PGK, and Xist in preimplantation bovine embryos. In experiment 1, sex-determined IVP or in vivo-produced embryos were analyzed for mRNA expression of the 3 genes. The sex ratio was 36% vs. 64% in IVP blastocysts and thus deviated significantly from the expected ratio of 50% in the vivo control group. The RA of G6PD transcripts was significantly higher in female IVP embryos than in male embryos. In contrast, no significant differences were seen between in vivo-derived female embryos and their male counterparts. At the morula stage, female IVP embryos transcribed significantly more PGK mRNA than did male embryos. However, blastocysts did not exhibit significant differences in PGK transcripts. No differences were observed for in vivo-derived embryos with regard to the RA of PGK transcripts. The RA of Xist mRNA was significantly higher in all female embryos than in their male counterparts. In experiment 2, IVP, in vivo-developed, NT-derived, and parthenogenetic embryos carrying two X chromosomes of either maternal and paternal origin or of maternal origin only (parthenogenotes) were analyzed for the RA of the 3 genes. In NT-derived morulae, the RA of G6PD transcripts was significantly increased compared with their IVP and in vivo-generated counterparts. G6PD transcript levels were significantly increased in IVP blastocysts compared with in vivo-generated and parthenogenetic embryos. At the morula stage, PGK transcripts were similar in all groups, but the RA of PGK transcripts was significantly higher in IVP blastocysts than in their in vivo-generated, parthenogenetic, and NT-derived counterparts. The RA of Xist was significantly elevated in NT-derived morulae compared with IVP, in vivo-generated, and parthenogenetic embryos. NT-derived blastocysts showed an increased Xist expression compared with that of IVP, in vivo-generated, and parthenogenetic embryos. Results of the present study show for the first time that differences in X-chromosome-linked gene transcript levels are related to a perturbed dosage compensation in female and male IVP and female NT-derived embryos.

However, the standard RF algorithm does not correctly model the effects of X chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), leading to biased estimates of variable importance. We propose extensions of RF to correctly model X SNPs, including a stratified approach and an approach based on the process of X chromosome inactivation. We applied the new and standard RF approaches to case-control alcohol dependence data from the Study of Addiction: Genes and Environment (SAGE), and compared the performance of the alternative approaches via a simulation study. Standard RF applied to a case-control study of alcohol dependence yielded inflated variable importance estimates for X SNPs, even when sex was included as a variable, but the results of the new RF methods were consistent with univariate regression-based approaches that correctly model X chromosome data. Simulations showed that the new RF methods eliminate the bias in standard RF variable importance for X SNPs when sex is associated with the trait, and are able to detect causal autosomal and X SNPs. Even in the absence of sex effects, the new extensions perform similarly to standard RF. Thus, we provide a powerful multimarker approach for genetic analysis that accommodates X chromosome data in an unbiased way.

The two species are approximately the same size, but a female BW crossed with a male PO produces offspring that are smaller than either parent. In the reciprocal cross, the offspring are oversized and typically die before birth. Rare survivors are exclusively female, consistent with Haldane's rule, which states that in instances of hybrid sterility or inviability, the heterogametic sex tends to be more severely affected. To understand these sex- and parent-of-origin-specific patterns of overgrowth, we analysed reciprocal backcrosses. Our studies reveal that hybrid inviability is partially due to a maternally expressed X-linked PO locus and an imprinted paternally expressed autosomal BW locus. In addition, the hybrids display skewing of X-chromosome inactivation in favour of the expression of the BW X chromosome. The most severe overgrowth is accompanied by widespread relaxation of imprinting of mostly paternally expressed genes.

Approximately 90% of patients are female. We have produced data an X-chromosome gene dose effect increases susceptibility. Therefore, our objective is to functionally describe an X-linked protein which escapes X-inactivation, Chromosome X open reading frame 21 (CXorf21), to uncover any role this protein may have in the pathogenesis or susceptibility to SLE. Publicly available data predict CXorf21 is a dehydrogenase/reductase expressed almost exclusively in monocytes, B cells, and and other antigen-presenting cells. Additional studies show that CXorf21, a SLE risk allele, directly interacts with another SS/SLE-associated risk allele, Slc15a4. SLC15a4, a lysosomal proton-oligopeptide co-transporter, is necessary for endolysosomal antigen processing, TLR7- and NOD1-mediated cytokine as well as antibody production in dendritic cells and B cells. Methods: We used quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot protein analysis, Bio-plex cytokine immunoassay, and pHrodoTM assay, as well as, in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments to examine the role of CXorf21 in monocytes and B cell immunity. Results: Our data show that CXorf21 basal gene and protein expression is elevated in female primary monocytes and B cells compared to male cells. We also found CXorf21 mRNA expression was higher in both male and female SLE-affected EBV-transformed B cells and female primary Sjogren's Syndrome patient's PBMC subsets compared to healthy male controls. Additionally, we found that following activation by TLR7 (Imiquimod) and NOD1 (iE-DAP) agonists CXorf21, IFN-alpha, and NFkappaB expression increases, in addition to an increase IL-6 and TNF-αlpha cytokine production. This response is exaggerated in a female-specific manner. Successful knockdown of CXorf21, using CXorf21-specific gRNA (CRISPR-Cas9), abrogated both the expression levels and cytokine response in the female samples, but had not affect in male subjects. pHrodoTM lysosomal pH experiments revealed that knockdown of CXorf21 protein in healthy female monocytes resulted in an increased lysosomal pH. As result of the increase from acidic to a more alkaline lysosomal environment in the female samples (auto)antigen processing is perceived to be disrupted. Conclusion: CXorf21 is over-expressed in female immune cells compared to male cells and is involved in a sex-dependent dimorphic response to activation through TLR7 and NOD1. We propose that CXorf21 via interaction with the lysosome proton cotransporter, SLC15a4, maintains the lysosomal pH gradient necessary for monocyte and B cell immune response.

We reported that the female placenta has a unique profile of genes escaping XCI (Gong et al. JCI Insight). The placental-specific XCI escapee, SMS regulates polyamine metabolism and is dysregulated in preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. Here, we examined the relationship between polyamines and mitochondrial metabolism, and tested the hypothesis that SMS mediates the sexdifferences in placental mitochondrial metabolism. Methods: Polyamines and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates were measured in healthy term placentas (n=108) by LC-MS. Primary human trophoblast cells (PHTs) were isolated from term placentas (n=60) and depleted of polyamines either by treatment with a polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor (DFMO) for 24h or transfected with SMS siRNA 72h prior to downstream analyses. Transcriptomic changes were identified by RNA-seq and validated by western blots. Mitochondrial respiration was measured on an extracellular flux analyzer. All PHT experiments were repeated in n=10 placentas for each sex. Results: SMS mRNA and protein levels were ∼50% higher in female placentas (P<0.05). Linear regression analyses of placental metabolites demonstrated that the SMS product N1, N12-diacetylspermine was highly correlated with all of the TCA cycle intermediates (R2=0.33-0.41; P-adj<1.0x10-9). Polyamine depletion by DFMO altered 4710 transcripts in male PHTs and 3558 transcripts in females (P-adj<0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data identified significant enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and TCA cycle transcripts in male PHTs but not females (P-adj<0.05). DFMO also decreased protein levels of OXPHOS complexes III, IV and V in male PHTs. Lastly, polyamine depletion by DFMO or SMS siRNA decreased mitochondrial respiration in male PHTs only (P<0.05). Conclusion: We have identified a novel relationship between polyamine and mitochondrial metabolism. Polyamine metabolites are highly correlated with TCA cycle intermediates and polyamine depletion impairs mitochondrial respiration. Female PHTs are less susceptible to polyamine depletion due to higher SMS levels. These findings suggest that placental sex differences in polyamine metabolism may contribute to fetal sex differences in adverse pregnancy outcomes.",L626672659 2019-03-12,10.1177/1933719119834079,endogenous compound;messenger RNA;polyamine;small interfering RNA;spermine synthase;unclassified drug;adult;analyzer;citric acid cycle;complication;conference abstract;female;gene expression;human;human cell;intrauterine growth retardation;linear regression analysis;liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;major clinical study;male;mitochondrial respiration;outcome assessment;oxidative phosphorylation;placenta;polyamine metabolism;preeclampsia;pregnancy complication;pregnancy outcome;protein expression;sex difference;trophoblast;Western blotting;X chromosome inactivation;Sex Characteristics;X Chromosome;Placenta,,

Since there is no other hemophiliac in the kindred, it is not possible to state whether this is a characteristic feature or not. His clinical state is, however, very severe and thus better related to his low VIII:C level. The findings exclude dominant hemophilia, phenotypic and X-chromosome abnormalities as the cause of this female hemophilia. Whether a homozygocity or an extreme lyonisation is the underlying cause cannot be entirely decided at present. Because the father refused to donate blood, it has not been possible to assess his factor VIII parameters. However, neither he nor any other in the kindred has shown signs of increased bleeding tendency. Since there is no particular reason to doubt the paternity and since genetic transfer from the father would require that he be a severe hemophiliac to account for the girl's low factor VIII:C level, homozygocity is unlikely. A mutation cannot be excluded, however. Since the chance for the latter possibility is very small, the most probable reason for the low factor VIII:C level is extreme lyonisation which is the most common cause of female hemophilia.

Male hemizygotes are generally more severely affected than heterozygote females. Clinical disease in females is thought to be due to unequal X chromosome inactivation. Case: A 19-year-old woman, who was previously well, presented with neurological deficits secondary to basal ganglia and pontine infarction. Extensive cardiac, arterial and hematologic investigations did not identify the etiology of her stroke. Muscle biopsy revealed endothelial lysosomal aggregates most consistent with a diagnosis of Fabry's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of molecular genotype analysis. Discussion: Inherited causes of stroke such as Fabry's disease should be considered in young patients with stroke if an etiologic diagnosis is not reached after complete investigations.

This bias was not attributable to X chromosome-inactivation defects, differential replication licensing or X versus Y chromosome size, but rather to ‘maleness’—XX embryos could be rescued by transgene-mediated sex reversal or testosterone administration. The ability of exogenous or endogenous testosterone to protect embryos was related to its anti-inflammatory properties5. Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, rescued female embryos that contained mutations in not only the Mcm genes but also the Fancm gene; similar to MCM mutants, Fancm mutant embryos have increased levels of genomic instability (measured as the number of cells with micronuclei) from compromised replication fork repair6. In addition, deficiency in the anti-inflammatory IL10 receptor was synthetically lethal with the Mcm4Chaos3 helicase mutant.

The comparison of concordance rates between monozygotic and dizygotic twins provides irrefutable evidence of a genetic component in the aetiology of both Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, as well as for harbouring thyroid autoantibodies. Biometric modelling shows that approximately 75% of the total phenotypic variance in autoimmune thyroid disease is due to genetic effects. Despite the well known gender difference in the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease, the analyzes suggest that it is the same set of genes that operate in males and females. The lack of complete phenotypic concordance in monozygotic twin pairs indicates that also environmental and/or epigenetic factors are of importance. The impact of specific environmental and epigenetic exposures can be evaluated by investigating disease discordant twin pairs. Our studies show that skewed X chromosome inactivation is associated with clinically overt AITD but not with the presence of TPOAb in euthyroid individuals.

Although they copurify during preparation and their gene loci are mapped to the short arm of the human X chromosome where they appear to have escaped from X inactivation, it has not been settled whether STS and ARC are the same enzyme or not. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that ARC exists in two electrophoretically distinct forms in human fibroblasts. We now report that these two forms--the faster migrating (F) and more slowly migrating (S)--occur in human tissues. Each of 11 human tissue types from 10 subjects showed a consistent pattern of ARC isozymes. Thyroid, heart, spleen, skeletal muscle, and adrenal tissue mainly had the S form. In contrast, kidney, liver, and pancreas tissue had mainly the F form, while gonadal, lung, and intestinal tissue had both the S and the F forms. The question of escape of their gene locus from X-chromosome inactivation was examined by comparing the specific activities of ARC and STS in male-derived vis-à-vis female-derived tissues. The majority of the tissues did not show any significant difference in these activities between the sexes, the exceptions being heart muscle, gonadal, and kidney tissue. None showed the 1:2 ratio between male- and female-derived tissues expected of a locus that had escaped X inactivation. The question of identity between ARC and STS was examined by comparing the ratios of their activities in these tissue types: if the enzymes were identical, the ratios of their activities should have remained constant across the different tissue types. It was thus shown that ARC activity varied by as much as 100-fold, depending on the ARC isozymic pattern of the tissue. STS, measured as estrone sulfatase and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfatase, did not show similar variations. This provides further evidence that ARC activity is not necessarily identical to that of STS.","1537-6605 Munroe, D G Chang, P L Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 1987/02/01 Am J Hum Genet. 1987 Feb;40(2):102-14.",,"Arylsulfatases/analysis/*genetics;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Female;Genetic Markers;Humans;Isoenzymes/*genetics;Male;Sex Factors;Steryl-Sulfatase;Sulfatases/analysis/*genetics;Tissue Distribution;Humanities;Humanism;Organ Specificity",,

As skewed XCI has been linked to development of some solid tumors, including ovarian, breast, and pulmonary and esophageal carcinomas, it is challenging to elucidate the relation of skewed XCI to high-grade gliomas development. The present study aimed to determine the general concordance between XCI pattern in blood cells and brain tissues, and SXCI frequencies in female patients with high-grade glioma compared to healthy controls. 1,103 Chinese females without a detectable tumor and 173 female high-grade glioma patients, were detected in the study. Normal brain tissues surrounding the lesions in gliomas were obtained from 49 patients among the 173 ones, with the microdissection using a laser microdissection microscope Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood cells and the normal brain tissues from the subjects. Exon 1 of androgen receptor (AR) gene was amplified, and its products of different alleles were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized after silver staining. The corrected ratios (CR) of the products before and after HpaII digestion were calculated. Occurrence of SXCI was detected in both the patients and controls at similar frequencies. However, the phenomenon, as defined as CR ≥ 3, was more frequent in the patients aging ≤ 40 (23.6%) compared to the corresponding reference group (5.1%, P <0.0001). When CR ≥ 10 was adopted, the frequencies were 5.5% and 1.6%, respectively. Their difference did not attain statistical significance (P=0.10). When detected, both blood cells and brain tissue were compared after determination of a high concordance of XCI between blood cells and brain tissue collected from the same individuals (n=48, r =0.57, P <0.01). The data from the current study demonstrated that SXCI may be a predisposing factor for development of high-grade glioma in young female patients and further study will verify its suitability as a biomarker to assess susceptibility of young female patients to high-grade glioma.

This sex difference is most often attributed to the usual suspects: differences in hormones and life experiences. However, the fact that XY males have only one X chromosome undoubtedly contributes to this vulnerability, as any mutation that affects a gene on their X chromosome will affect their only copy of that gene. On the other hand, cellular mosaicism created by X inactivation provides a biologic advantage to females. There are 1100 genes on the X chromosome, and most of them are not expressed from the Y chromosome. Therefore, sex differences in the expression of these genes are likely to underlie many sex differences in the expression of diseases affected by these genes. In fact, this genetic biology should be considered for any disease or phenotype that occurs in one sex more than the other, because the disease mechanism may be influenced directly by an X-linked gene or indirectly through the consequences of X inactivation. © 2007 Excerpta Medica, Inc.",L47245012 2007-06-01,10.1016/s1550-8579(07)80024-6,DNA methyltransferase 3B;ephrin B1;testis determining factor;article;autoimmune disease;chromatin assembly and disassembly;chromosome deletion;chromosome translocation;disease severity;Fabry disease;gene deletion;gene expression;gene expression regulation;gene mutation;genetic transcription;genetic variability;heterozygote;human;Hunter syndrome;Lesch Nyhan syndrome;molecular evolution;mortality;nonhuman;pathogenesis;phenotype;priority journal;sex chromosome mosaicism;sex difference;sex differentiation;SRY gene;testis development;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X chromosome linked disorder;Y chromosome;Sex Characteristics;X Chromosome,,

Our results show that the differential gene expression pattern between age groups is dominated by down-regulated transcriptional activities in the old subjects. Functional analysis on age-regulated genes identifies cell-cell signaling as an important functional category implicated in human aging. Sex-dependent gene expression is characterized by genes that may escape X-inactivation and, most interestingly, such a pattern is not affected by the aging process. Analysis on sibship correlation on gene expression revealed a large number of significant genes suggesting the importance of a genetic mechanism in regulating transcriptional activities. In addition, we observe an interesting pattern of sibship correlation on gene expression that increases exponentially with the mean of gene expression reflecting the enhanced genetic control over the functionally active genes.","1089-8646 Tan, Qihua Zhao, Jinghua Li, Shuxia Christiansen, Lene Kruse, Torben A Christensen, Kaare MC_U106188470/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom P01 AG008761/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

MECP2 mutations have been found in people with various disorders, including neonatal onset encephalopathy, X-linked recessive mental retardation (MRX), classic and a typical RTT, autism, and Angelman syndrome, as well as mildly affected females and normal carrier females. To make matters more complex, in approximately 20% of classic sporadic RTT cases and more than 50% of affected sister pairs, no mutation in MECP2 has been found. X-chromosome inactivation patterns can clearly affect the phenotypic expression in females, while the effect of the type and position of the mutation is more apparent in the broader phenotype than in RTT. Both males and females are at risk, although an excess of paternally derived mutations are found in most cases of classic RTT.

We examined how sexual dimorphism affected conceptus transcript abundance and amino acid composition as well as the endometrial transcriptome during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy. Of the 5132 genes that were differentially expressed on Day 19 in male compared to female conceptuses, 2.7% were located on the X chromosome. Concentrations of specific amino acids were higher in the uterine luminal fluid of male compared to female conceptuses, while female conceptuses had higher transcript abundance of specific amino acid transporters (SLC6A19 and SLC1A35). Of note, the endometrial transcriptome was not different in cattle gestating a male or a female conceptus. These data support the hypothesis that, far from being a blastocyst-specific phenomenon, XCI is incomplete before and during implantation in cattle.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of low concentration 5-aza-CdR treatment on the methylation status of imprinted gene Xist in different genders of buffalo bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). BMSCs were isolated and the cell gender was identified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Then different concentrations of 5-aza-CdR (0, 0.02, 0.1 mu M) were applied for the treatment. The results showed cellular morphology, growth, Xist gene expression pattern, and adherent ability were not significantly affected with the treatment of 5-aza-CdR for 24 hours. Meanwhile, immunofluorescence analysis indicated that the expression of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) was also not influenced after the treatment. However, bisulfite sequence PCR (BS-PCR) analysis revealed that the methylation level of Xist differentially methylated region (DMR) decreased significantly when the concentration of 5-aza-CdR increased to 0.1 mu M in the female BMSCs group (p < 0.05), while there was no significant difference among the male BMSCs-treated groups. Our results implied that low concentrations of 5-aza-CdR treatment had little impacts on cellular morphology, growth Xist gene expression pattern, adherent ability, and global DNA methylation level of BMSCs in both genders, but the treatment could significantly decrease the methylation level of Xist DMR in female BMSCs.

For each of these, men and women display distinct differences in disease development and progression. To date, studies on the molecular basis of such differences have largely focused on sex hormones, typically highlighting their neuroprotective benefits. However, new research suggests that cellular senescence may underlie sex differences in both neurological and non-neurological pathologies. Cellular senescence—stable proliferative arrest with a unique pro-inflammatory phenotype—occurs in response to persistent DNA damage signaling, safeguarding against tissue-level consequences of DNA damage (e.g., tumorigenesis). Though critical for maintaining tissue health, senescence has also been implicated in disease. Indeed, senescent cell accumulation occurs in multiple disease contexts, and the elimination of such cells (via senolytic therapies) alleviates associated disease hallmarks. If cell senescence is a driver of pathophysiology, sex differences in cellular senescence may underlie sex-specific disease outcomes. This review summarizes evidence of sex differences in cellular senescence—highlighting findings from both human and animal studies—and briefly discusses the potential relevance of sex chromosome epigenetics and mosaicism. Current studies show that female sex is associated with greater susceptibility to DNA damage and greater likelihood of senescence onset, despite additional evidence that estrogen protects against genotoxic insult and inhibits senescence regulatory proteins. Further studies on sex differences in cellular senescence are needed, both to verify whether findings from animal studies hold true in human contexts and to validate whether senescence manifests differently between men and women following comparable senescence-inducing stimuli.",L2020355973 2022-09-29 2022-10-04,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2022.08.014,estrogen;progesterone;testosterone;bioaccumulation;cell aging;DNA damage response;enzyme inhibition;epigenetics;genotoxicity;human;mosaicism;nonhuman;pathophysiology;phenotype;review;senescence-associated secretory phenotype;sex chromosome;sex difference;signal transduction;X chromosome inactivation;Sex Characteristics,,

Two possible explanations have been tested here. One is that embryos of one sex are differentially susceptible to oxidative stress. The second is that female EB produce more IFN-τ because pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) activity is elevated as a result of delayed X-chromosome inactivation. IVP bovine zygotes were cultured to the 8-cell stage and placed under conditions designed either to promote oxidative stress (±H 2O2; 20 vs. 5% O2), or to inhibit glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity (addition of dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA or 6-aminonicotinamide, 6-AN to the medium). At day 8, blastocysts were cultured individually for a further 48 hr to assess IFN-τ production, and embryo sex determined retrospectively. Blastocyst numbers were reduced (P < 0.05) and their continued development impaired (P < 0.05) in presence of H2O2 (200 μM) and 20% O2, but neither IFN-τ production nor sexually dimorphic expression of IFN-τ were affected. IFN-τ production was reduced, particularly in females (P < 0.05), and sexual dimorphic differences in production were lost in the presence of both DHEA (100 μM) and 6-AN (1 μM). In the case of 6-AN, these effects were achieved without a significant decline in blastocyst developmental progression, quality, or cell number. The data suggest that the higher production of IFN-τ by female EB is an indirect outcome of the increased activity of the oxidative arm of the PPP pathway. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",L38420523 2004-04-22,10.1002/mrd.20053,6 aminonicotinamide;glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase;luteolytic agent;prasterone;tau interferon;animal cell;article;autosome;blastocyst;bovine;cell count;controlled study;embryo;embryo culture;embryo development;enzyme inhibition;female;in vitro study;interferon production;male;morula;nonhuman;outcomes research;oxidation;oxidation reduction state;oxidative stress;pentose phosphate cycle;priority journal;retrospective study;sex determination;sex difference;sex ratio;X chromosome inactivation;zygote;Oxidative Stress,,

Inviability in mammalian hybrids is associated with parent-of-origin placental growth abnormalities for which misregulation of imprinted gene (IGs) is the leading candidate mechanism. However, direct evidence for the involvement of IGs in hybrid growth dysplasia is limited. We used transcriptome and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to conduct the first genome-scale assessment of the contribution of IGs to parent-of-origin placental growth dysplasia in the cross between the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) and the Algerian mouse (Mus spretus). IGs with transgressive expression and methylation were concentrated in the Kcnq1 cluster, which contains causal genes for prenatal growth abnormalities in mice and humans. Hypermethylation of the cluster's imprinting control region, and consequent misexpression of the genes Phlda2 and Ascl2, is a strong candidate mechanism for transgressive placental undergrowth. Transgressive placental and gene regulatory phenotypes, including expression and methylation in the Kcnq1 cluster, were more extreme in hybrid males. Although consistent with Haldane's rule, male-biased defects are unexpected in rodent placenta because the X-chromosome is effectively hemizygous in both sexes. In search of an explanation, we found evidence of leaky imprinted (paternal) X-chromosome inactivation in hybrid female placenta, an epigenetic disturbance that may buffer females from the effects of X-linked incompatibilities to which males are fully exposed. Sex differences in chromatin structure on the X and sex-biased maternal effects are nonmutually exclusive alternative explanations for adherence to Haldane's rule in hybrid placenta.

Although genetically identical to their donor somatic cells, iPSCs undergo substantial changes in the epigenetic landscape during reprogramming. One such epigenetic process, X chromosome inactivation (XCI), has recently been shown to vary widely in human female iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). XCI is a form of dosage compensation whose chief regulator is the noncoding RNA Xist. In mouse iPSCs and ESCs, Xist expression and XCI strictly correlate with the pluripotent state, but no such correlation exists in humans. Lack of XIST expression in human cells is linked to reduced developmental potential and an altered transcriptional profile, including upregulation of genes associated with cancer, which has therefore led to concerns about the safety of pluripotent stem cells for use in regenerative medicine. In this review, we describe how different states of XIST expression define three classes of female human pluripotent stem cells and explore progress in discovering the reasons for these variations and how they might be countered.

M. and Pomiankowski, A.",,,,,"We define ESS (Evolutionary Stable Strategy) conditions for the evolution of genomic imprinting at an X-linked locus. The system analysed is designed for mammalian imprinting in which X-linked genes typically undergo random X-inactivation and lack Y-linked homologues. We consider two models that map cellular gene expression to fitness in females subject to random X-inactivation. In the first model, female fitness is simply a function of the average gene expression across all cells. In the second model, each cell contributes independently to fitness, and female fitness is assessed as the average of these contributions across all cells. In both models, imprinting readily evolves when sexual selection favours different levels of gene expression in the two sexes. Imprinting is beneficial as it improves adaptation in both sexes. There are limits to the improvement in adaptation when sexual selection is strong and favours greater gene expression in males (the heterogametic sex).

Many ncRNAs, including both microRNAs and long non-coding transcripts, show almost exclusive or predominant expression in the placenta compared with other somatic tissues and display altered expression patterns in placentas from complicated pregnancies. In this review, we explore the results of recent genome-scale and single gene expression studies using human placental tissue, but include studies in the mouse where human data are lacking.

The short stature homeobox-containing gene resides in the telomeric PAR1 region on the short arm of both sex chromosomes and escapes X inactivation. For this review, abstracts of 207 publications presented by PubMed for the search term 'SHOX' were screened. Heterozygote SHOX mutations (80% deletions) were detected in 2-15% of individuals with formerly idiopathic short stature, in 50-90% of individuals with Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, and in almost 100% of girls with Turner syndrome. Mutational analysis is primarily performed by MLPA analysis followed by gene sequencing if necessary. SHOX is a nuclear protein that binds to DNA and acts as a transcriptional activator. Orthologs are present in many vertebrates but not in rodents. Gene expression starting as early as 33 days postconception in humans is predominant in the mid portion of the buds and in the first and second pharyngeal arches. In the growth plate, hypertrophic chondrocytes express SHOX where it seems to have antiproliferative potency. The penetrance of SHOX deficiency is high, but its clinical expression is very variable becoming more pronounced with age and being more severe in females. Growth failure starts early during the first years of life and the height deficit present at preschool age seems not to deteriorate further. The mean adult height is -2.2 SDS. Auxological analysis of the body proportions (mesomelia), the presence of minor abnormalities, and the search for subtle radiographic signs are important keys to the diagnosis which has to be confirmed by genetic analysis. The growth-promoting effect of GH therapy approved for individuals with SHOX mutations seems to be equal to the effect seen in Turner syndrome. Copyright © 2011 S.

For example, gene expression is sexually dimorphic during brain development, adult life, and aging. These differences are orchestrated by the interplay between genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin these differences have not been fully elucidated. Because recent studies have highlighted the key roles played by epigenetic processes in regulating gene expression and mediating brain form and function, this chapter reviews emerging evidence that shows how epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are responsible for promoting sexual dimorphism in the brain. Differential profiles of DNA methylation and histone modifications are found in dimorphic brain regions such as the hypothalamus as a result of sex hormone exposure during developmental critical periods. The elaboration of specific epigenetic marks is also linked with regulating sex hormone signaling pathways later in life. Furthermore, the expression and function of epigenetic factors such as the methyl-CpG-binding protein, MeCP2, and the histone-modifying enzymes, UTX and UTY, are sexually dimorphic in the brain. ncRNAs are also implicated in promoting sex differences. For example, X inactivation-specific transcript (. XIST) is a long ncRNA that mediates X chromosome inactivation, a seminal developmental process that is particularly important in brain. These observations imply that understanding epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate dimorphic gene expression and function, is necessary for developing a more comprehensive view of sex differences in brain. These emerging findings also suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are, in part, responsible for the differential susceptibility between males and females that is characteristic of a spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",L360018996 2010-12-02 2010-12-07,10.1016/b978-0-444-53630-3.00006-3,DNA;methyl CpG binding protein 2;microRNA;sex hormone;untranslated RNA;aging;book;brain development;DNA methylation;genetic modification;epigenetics;female;gene expression;gene expression regulation;genetic susceptibility;human;male;mental disease;neurologic disease;nonhuman;priority journal;sex difference;X chromosome inactivation;Brain;Sex Characteristics;Disease Susceptibility,,

A. and Oecd",,,,,"X-chromosome inactivation is the mechanism by which mammals equalize X-linked gene products between females and males. The choice of X chromosome to be inactivated is random, occurs early in embryonic development and results in stable silencing of genes on the inactive X chromosome. However, some genes are known to escape the inactivation process and while X-inactivation is a universal phenomenon among mammals, species-specific differences dictate which ones will be expressed or silenced. With the X chromosome representing approximately 5% of the human genome, its anomalies lead to severe phenotypical and physiological alterations. On the other hand, X-inactivation is a major epigenetic event and therefore can provide invaluable insight into processes such as nuclear reprogramming during nuclear transfer or the impact of the environment on gene expression. Starting with total RNA extracted from muscle samples obtained from male and female bovine fetuses we hybridized human 19K cDNA microarray slides (Ontario Cancer Institute). The hybridization of human chips with bovine samples was successful with consistent high hybridization spots and low background. A total of 188 JESTS were consistently up regulated in female versus male samples. Of these, 36 (19.1%) were unknown, 147 (78.2%) were autosomal and 5 (2.7%) were X-linked. The expression differences of these candidate genes will be confirmed using real-time PCR. These results suggest that the use of heterologous hybridization is a useful tool in the screening of bovine genes.

There are currently few benchmarks for assessing quality. Here we show that X-inactivation markers can be used to separate hiPSC lines into distinct epigenetic classes and that the classes are phenotypically distinct. Loss of XIST expression is strongly correlated with upregulation of X-linked oncogenes, accelerated growth rate in vitro, and poorer differentiation in vivo. Whereas differences in X-inactivation potential result in epigenetic variability of female hiPSC lines, male hiPSC lines generally resemble each other and do not overexpress the oncogenes. Neither physiological oxygen levels nor HDAC inhibitors offer advantages to culturing female hiPSC lines. We conclude that female hiPSCs may be epigenetically less stable in culture and caution that loss of XIST may result in qualitatively less desirable stem cell lines. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",L365200452 2012-07-17 2012-07-23,10.1016/j.stem.2012.03.008,histone deacetylase inhibitor;oxygen;protein;unclassified drug;x inactive specific transcript;article;cell differentiation;cell growth;epigenetics;female;gene expression;gene identification;genetic association;human;human cell;in vitro study;in vivo study;male;nucleotide sequence;phenotype;pluripotent stem cell;priority journal;sex difference;tumor gene;upregulation;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Sex Characteristics,,

In a previous genome wide screen, we reported linkage of autism with a 1.2 Megabase interval on chromosome 5q31. For the current study, we hypothesized that 3 of the genes in this region could be involved in the development of autism: 1) paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1), which is a key regulator of hormones within the pituitary-hypothalamic axis, 2) neurogenin 1, a transcription factor involved in neurogenesis, and 3) histone family member Y (H2AFY), which is involved in X-chromosome inactivation in females and could explain the 4:1 male:female gender distortion present in autism. METHODS: A total of 276 families from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) repository composed of 1086 individuals including 530 affected children were included in the study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging the three candidate genes were genotyped on the initial linkage sample of 116 families. A second step of analysis was performed using tightly linked SNPs covering the PITX1 gene. Association was evaluated using the FBAT software version 1.7.3 for single SNP analysis and the HBAT command from the same package for haplotype analysis respectively. RESULTS: Association between SNPs and autism was only detected for PITX1. Haplotype analysis within PITX1 showed evidence for overtransmission of the A-C haplotype of markers rs11959298 - rs6596189 (p = 0.0004). Individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the A-C haplotype risk allele were 2.54 and 1.59 fold more likely to be autistic than individuals who were not carrying the allele, respectively. CONCLUSION: Strong and consistent association was observed between a 2 SNPs within PITX1 and autism.

Androgen may act directly on motoneurons to regulate N-cad expression, or indirectly, via effects on androgen-sensitive afferent or efferent structures. Here, we describe a genetic mosaic investigation of this site-of-action indeterminacy. Following developmental random X chromosome inactivation, androgenized female rats heterozygous for the tfm androgen receptor mutation (XWTXtfm) are phenotypic mosaics of androgen-sensitive wild-type (WT) and androgen-insensitive (tfm) motoneurons. We compared steroid effects on WT and tfm cells in two sexually-dimorphic motoneuron pools, the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus (SNB) and the dorsolateral nucleus (DLN), as well as a less steroid responsive motoneuron pool, the sexually monomorphic retrodorsolateral nucleus (RDLN). Independent of steroid treatment, a greater proportion of wild-type cells were N-cad immunoreactive (IR) in the DLN and RDLN. Following testosterone treatment, increased N-cad expression was observed in both cell types in the DLN, but in the SNB only the androgen-competent WT cells increased N-cad expression. Testosterone treatment did not significantly alter N-cad expression in the mosaic RDLN.

Ascertainment bias probably explains this bias, rather than a link with X-chromosome inactivation as previously suggested, because the families from the USA were ascertained for the purposes of linkage studies whereas those from Australia were ascertained through Familial Cancer Clinics to which they had been referred for clinical genetic counseling and mutation testing.","Chenevix-Trench, G Sinilnikova, O M Suthers, G Pandeya, N Mazoyer, S Sambrook, J F Goldup, S Goldgar, D Lynch, H T Lenoir, G M Cheetham, G kConFab Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Netherlands 2005/06/14 Fam Cancer. 2005;4(2):73-5. doi: 10.1007/s10689-004-2102-y.",10.1007/s10689-004-2102-y,"Adult;Australia/epidemiology;Breast Neoplasms/genetics;Chromosomes, Human, X;Cohort Studies;Female;*Genes, BRCA1;*Genes, BRCA2;*Heterozygote;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Male;Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics;Pedigree;*Sex Ratio;United States/epidemiology",,

To study the phenomenon of marsupial XCI more comprehensively, we profiled parent-of-origin allele-specific expression, DNA methylation, and histone modifications in fetal brain and extra-embryonic membranes in the gray, short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica). The majority of X-linked genes (152 of 176 genes with trackable SNP variants) exhibited paternally imprinted expression, with nearly 100% of transcripts derived from the maternal allele; whereas 24 loci (14%) escaped inactivation, showing varying levels of biallelic expression. In addition to recently reported evidence of marsupial XCI regulation by the noncoding Rsx transcript, strong depletion of H3K27me3 at escaper gene loci in the present study suggests that histone state modifications also correlate strongly with opossum XCI. In contrast to mouse, the opossum did not show an association between X-linked gene expression and promoter DNA methylation, with one notable exception. Unlike all other X-linked genes examined, Rsx was differentially methylated on the maternal and paternal X chromosomes, and expression was exclusively from the inactive (paternal) X chromosome. Our study provides the first comprehensive catalog of parent-of-origin expression status for X-linked genes in a marsupial and sheds light on the regulation and evolution of imprinted XCI in mammals. © 2014 Wang et al.",L372052507 2014-01-14 2014-01-16,10.1101/gr.161919.113,transcriptome;allele;article;brain;chromatin;chromosome analysis;chromosome wide profiling;controlled study;CpG island;DNA methylation;embryo membrane;epigenetics;female;fetus;gene expression;gene locus;histone modification;male;Monodelphis domestica;nonhuman;opossum;placenta;priority journal;promoter region;pyrosequencing;sex difference;single nucleotide polymorphism;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome;Brain;Placenta,,

The presence of male cell material can be readily assessed by the incorporation of Y-chromosomal markers in quantitation or STR profiling systems. However, no forensic marker exists to positively identify female cell material; merely the presence of female DNA is deduced from the absence of a Y peak, or unbalanced X-Y signals at the Amelogenin locus or unbalanced response of the total and Y-specific quantifier. The presence of two X-chromosomes in female cells invokes dosage compensation, which is achieved through inactivation of one of the X-chromosomes in females. Since this process involves specific RNA molecules, identification of female cellular material may be possible through RNA profiling. Additionally, male material may be identified through RNAs expressed from the Y-chromosome. RNAs preferentially expressed in either sex were assessed for their potential to act as sex markers in forensic RNA assays. To confirm sex-specificity, body fluids and organ tissues of multiple donors of either sex were tested. Additionally, sensitivity of the markers and the suitability of positively identifying male-female mixtures were assessed and degraded samples were used to assess performance of the markers in forensic settings. The addition of sex-specific markers is of added informative value in any RNA profiling system and both markers were incorporated into existing RNA assays that either target body fluids or organs.

We performed a meta-analysis of sex-biased gene expression in Anopheles gambiae which provides evidence for a general underrepresentation of male-biased genes on the X-chromosome that increased in significance with the observed degree of sex-bias. A phylogenomic comparison between Drosophila melanogaster, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus also indicates that the Anopheles X chromosome strongly disfavours the evolutionary conservation of male-biased expression and that novel male-biased genes are more likely to arise on autosomes. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that transgenes situated on the Anopheles gambiae X chromosome are transcriptionally silenced in the male germline. The data presented here support the hypothesis that the observed demasculinization of the Anopheles X chromosome is driven by X-chromosome inactivation in the male germline and by sexual antagonism.

The Y chromosome is unique in males. Genes expressed in males on the Y chromosome that are associated with stroke may be important genetic contributors to the unique features of males with ischemic stroke, which would be helpful for explaining sex differences observed between men and women. Objective: We compared Y chromosome gene expression in males with ischemic stroke and male controls. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 40 male patients <= 3, 5, and 24 hours after ischemic stroke and from 41 male controls (July 2003 April 2007). RNA was isolated from blood and was processed using Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, California). Y chromosome genes differentially expressed between male patients with stroke and male control subjects were identified using an ANCOVA adjusted for age and batch. A P < 0.05 and a fold change >1.2 were considered significant. Results: Seven genes on the Y chromosome were differentially expressed in males with ischemic stroke compared with controls. Five of these genes (VAMP7, CSF2RA, SPRY3, DHRSX, and PLCXD1) are located on pseudoautosomal regions of the human Y chromosome. The other 2 genes (EIF1AY and DDX3Y) are located on the nonrecombining region of the human Y chromosome. The identified genes were associated with immunology, RNA metabolism, vesicle fusion, and angiogenesis. Conclusions: Specific genes on the Y chromosome are differentially expressed in blood after ischemic stroke. These genes provide insight into potential molecular contributors to sex differences in ischemic stroke. (Gend Med. 2012;9:68-75) (C) 2012 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

There is a need to continue examining neuro-immune-endocrine crosstalk in the context of sexual dimorphisms in chronic pain. Several phenomena in particular need to be further explored. In patients, autoantibodies to neural antigens have been associated with sensory pathway hyper-excitability, and the role of self-antigens released by damaged nerves remains to be defined. In addition, specific immune cells release pro-nociceptive cytokines that directly influence neural firing, while T lymphocytes activated by specific antigens secrete factors that either support nerve repair or exacerbate the damage. Modulating specific immune cell populations could therefore be a means to promote nerve recovery, with sex-specific outcomes. Understanding biological sex differences that maintain, or fail to maintain, neuroimmune homeostasis may inform the selection of sex-specific treatment regimens, improving chronic pain management by rebalancing neuroimmune feedback.

Prenatal stress is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, including early onset schizophrenia and autism. In our mouse model of early prenatal stress (EPS), stress exposure during the first week of gestation imparts long-term neurodevelopmental programming deficits in male offspring resulting in hypersensitivity to stress, cognitive impairments, and alterations in metabolic programming. The placenta, a fetally-derived organ reflecting fetal sex, acts as an arbitrator between the mother and fetus, providing necessary factors for early fetal neurodevelopment. Thus, sex differences in placental function may dramatically influence sex bias in vulnerability to prenatal insults. Methods and results: We previously identified the X-linked, stress-sensitive, nutrient sensor O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (OGT) as a placental biomarker of prenatal stress. OGT escapes X-inactivation in the placenta, providing females with increased expression. Placental-specific reduction of OGT recapitulates our EPS phenotype. Using ChIP-Seq, biochemistry, and RNA-Seq in mouse placentas with trophoblast-specific OGT reduction, we found that OGT determines genome-wide sex differences in H3K27me3 and gene expression in placental trophoblasts. Further, RNA-Seq of the embryonic hypothalamus revealed that reducing OGT in the female placenta masculinized the expression of key genes associated with hypothalamic development, suggesting that placental OGT contributes to sex differences in brain development. Conclusions: We hypothesize that female-biased epigenetic repression protects females from prenatal insults.

Akodon heterogametic females produce X and Y* oocytes, which upon sperm fertilization give rise to viable XX (female), XY* (female), and XY (male) embryos, and to non-viable Y*Y zygotes. Heterozygous females exhibit a better reproductive performance than XX females in order to compensate the Y*Y zygote wastage. XY* sex reversed females are assumed to occur due to a deficient Sry expression resulting in the development of ovaries instead of testes. Moreover, the appearance of Y* elements is a highly recurrent event. It is proposed that homo-zygosity for an autosomal or pseudoautosomal recessive mutation (s-) inhibits Sry expression giving rise to XY* embryos with ovary development. Location of the Y* chromosome in the female germ cell lineage produces an ovary-specific imprinting of the Sry* gene maintaining its defective expression through generations independently from the presence or absence of s- homozygosity. By escaping the ovary-specific methylation some Y* chromosomes turn back to normal Ys producing Y oocytes capable of generating normal male embryos when fertilized by an X sperm. Fluctuations in the rate of variant females in field populations and in laboratory colonies of Akodon depend on the balance between the appearance of new variant females (s-/s-, XY* specimens) and the extinction of sex reversed specimens due to imprinting escape.

For example, rapid cycling (RC) is more prevalent in females, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) is more prevalent in males. We hypothesize that X chromosome variants may be associated with sex-specific characteristics of BD. Few studies have explored the role of the X chromosome in BD, which is complicated by X chromosome inactivation (XCI). This process achieves ""dosage compensation"" for many X chromosome genes by silencing one of the two copies in females, and most statistical methods either ignore that XCI occurs or falsely assume that one copy is inactivated at all loci. We introduce new statistical methods that do not make these assumptions. METHODS: We investigated this hypothesis in 1001 BD patients from the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) and 957 BD patients from the Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder Biobank. We examined the association of over 14,000 X chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with sex-associated BD traits using two statistical approaches that account for whether a SNP may be undergoing or escaping XCI. In the ""XCI-informed approach,"" we fit a sex-adjusted logistic regression model assuming additive genetic effects where we coded the SNP either assuming one copy is expressed or two copies are expressed based on prior knowledge about which regions are inactivated. In the ""XCI-robust approach,"" we fit a logistic regression model with sex, SNP, and SNP-sex interaction effects that is flexible to whether the region is inactivated or escaping XCI. RESULTS: Using the ""XCI-informed approach,"" which considers only the main effect of SNP and does not allow the SNP effect to differ by sex, no significant associations were identified for any of the phenotypes. Using the ""XCI-robust approach,"" intergenic SNP rs5932307 was associated with BD (P = 8.3 × 10-8), with a stronger effect in females (odds ratio in males (ORM) = 1.13, odds ratio in females for a change of two allele copies (ORW2) = 3.86). CONCLUSION: X chromosome association studies should employ methods which account for its unique biology. Future work is needed to validate the identified associations with BD, to formally assess the performance of both approaches under different true genetic architectures, and to apply these approaches to study sex differences in other conditions.",L630139452 2019-12-18 2020-05-07,10.1186/s13293-019-0272-4,adult;bipolar disorder;female;genetics;genotype;human;male;middle aged;phenotype;sexual characteristics;single nucleotide polymorphism;statistical model;X chromosome;Bipolar Disorder;X Chromosome,,

IPEX is caused by mutations in FOXP3, and is thus the homologue of the scurfy mutant mouse. The gene product, Scurfin, is required for the development of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells. In the absence of T regulatory cells, activated CD4+ T cells instigate multi-organ damage resulting in type 1 diabetes, enteropathy, eczema, hypothyroidism, and other autoimmune disorders. While effective therapies are currently limited, studies in the scurfy mouse are revealing aspects of pathophysiology and genetics that will lead to novel approaches for treating IPEX and other autoimmune disorders.

A. and Hermenegildo, C. and Cano, A.",,,,,"BACKGROUND: In Western gender-neutral countries, the sex ratio at birth is estimated to be approximately 1.06. This ratio is lower than the estimated sex ratio at fertilization which ranges from 1.07 to 1.70 depending on the figures of sex ratio at birth and differential embryo/fetal mortality rates taken into account to perform these estimations. Likewise, little is known about the sex ratio at implantation in natural and assisted-reproduction-treatment (ART) cycles. In this bioessay, we aim to estimate the sex ratio at fertilization and implantation using data from embryos generated by standard in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycles. Thereafter, we compare sex ratios at implantation and birth in cleavage- and blastocyst-stage-transfer cycles to propose molecular mechanisms accounting for differences in post-implantation male and female mortality and thereby variations in sex ratios at birth in ART cycles. METHODS: A literature review based on publications up to December 2013 identified by PubMed database searches. RESULTS: Sex ratio at both fertilization and implantation is estimated to be between 1.29 and 1.50 in IVF cycles and 1.07 in ICSI cycles. Compared with the estimated sex ratio at implantation, sex ratio at birth is lower in IVF cycles (1.03 after cleavage-stage transfer and 1.25 after blastocyst-stage transfer) but similar and close to unity in ICSI cycles (0.95 after cleavage-stage transfer and 1.04 after blastocyst-stage transfer). CONCLUSIONS: In-vitro-culture-induced precocious X-chromosome inactivation together with ICSI-induced decrease in number of trophectoderm cells in female blastocysts may account for preferential female mortality at early post-implantation stages and thereby variations in sex ratios at birth in ART cycles.","1477-7827 Tarín, Juan J García-Pérez, Miguel A Hermenegildo, Carlos Cano, Antonio Comparative Study Journal Article Review England 2014/06/25 Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2014 Jun 23;12:56. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-12-56.",10.1186/1477-7827-12-56,"Animals;Blastocyst/cytology/pathology;Cleavage Stage, Ovum/cytology/pathology/transplantation;*Ectogenesis;Embryo Culture Techniques;Embryo Implantation;Embryo Loss/*etiology/pathology;Embryo Transfer/adverse effects;*Embryonic Development;Female;Fertilization in Vitro/*adverse effects;Humans;Infertility, Female/pathology/therapy;Infertility, Male;Live Birth;Male;Pregnancy;Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*adverse effects;*Sex Ratio;X Chromosome Inactivation;Sex Ratio;Self-Fertilization",,

B.",,,,,"A significant skewing in the sex ratio in favour of females has been reported for the families of homosexual men such that there are fewer maternal uncles than aunts. This finding is repeated for a large series of transsexual families in this study. Four hundred and seventeen male-to-female transsexuals and 96 female-to-male transsexuals were assessed. Male-to-female transsexuals have a significant excess of maternal aunts vs. uncles. No differences from the expected parity were found for female-to-male transsexuals or on the paternal side. A posited explanation for these findings invokes X inactivation and genes on the X chromosome that escape inactivation but may be imprinted. Our hypothesis incorporates the known familial traits in the families of homosexuals and transsexuals by way of retention of the grand parental epigenotype on the X chromosome. Generation one would be characterized by a failure to erase the paternal imprints on the paternal X chromosome. Daughters of this second generation would produce sons that are XpY and XmY. Since XpY expresses Xist, the X chromosome is silenced and half of the sons are lost at the earliest stages of pregnancy because of the normal requirement for paternal X expression in extra-embryonic tissues. Females survive by virtue of inheriting two X chromosomes, and therefore the possibility of X chromosome counting and choice during embryonic development. In generation three, sons inheriting the paternal X after its second passage through the female germline survive, but half would inherit the feminizing Xp imprinted genes. These genes could pre-dispose the sons to feminization and subsequent development of either homosexuality or transsexualism.","Green, R Keverne, E B Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2000/01/07 J Theor Biol. 2000 Jan 7;202(1):55-63. doi: 10.1006/jtbi.1999.1039.",10.1006/jtbi.1999.1039,"*Family Characteristics;Female;*Genomic Imprinting;Humans;Male;Models, Genetic;Pedigree;Pregnancy;*Sex Ratio;Transsexualism/*genetics;Genomics;Genome",,

Furthermore, during the pre-implantation period, in vitro produced male embryos have a higher metabolic rate, they grow faster than females, and they also have differential gene transcription of genes located in the Y-, X-, or in autosomal-chromosomes. As a consequence of these differences embryos may be affected differentially by natural or artificial environmental conditions, depending on their gender. It has been suggested that under some stress conditions male embryos are more vulnerable than females; however the biological fragility of male embryos is poorly understood. Evidences suggest that epigenetic differences produced by the presence of one or two X-chromosomes are the principal cause of the male and female pre-implantation differences, and we put forward the possible role of these early sex differences to control sex ratio of the offspring under different environmental conditions in Nature.

One early and irreversible process affecting gene expression, which can create differences within pairs of female monozygotic twins, is X inactivation - one twin can express mainly paternally-received genes on the X chromosome while the other twin expresses mainly maternally-received genes. It follows that non-identical X chromosome expression may cause female monozygotic twins to correlate less strongly than male monozygotic twins on complex behavioural traits affected by X-linked loci. We tested this hypothesis using data from around 4000 same-sex twin pairs on 9 social, behavioural and cognitive measures at ages 2, 3 and 4. Consistent with our hypothesis, monozygotic males were generally more similar than monozygotic females. Three of four significant differences were in traits showing higher correlations in males than females, and these traits - prosocial behaviour, peer problems, and verbal ability - have all been proposed previously in the literature as being influenced by genes on the X chromosome. Interestingly, dizygotic twins showed the reverse pattern of correlations for similar variables, which is also consistent with the X inactivation hypothesis; taken together, then, our monozygotic and dizygotic results suggest the presence of quantitative trait loci on the X chromosome.","Loat, Caroline S Asbury, Kathryn Galsworthy, Michael J Plomin, Robert Craig, Ian W Comparative Study Journal Article Twin Study Australia 2004/04/01 Twin Res. 2004 Feb;7(1):54-61. doi: 10.1375/13690520460741444.",10.1375/13690520460741444,"*Behavior;Child, Preschool;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Female;Humans;Male;Sex Factors;Twins, Monozygotic/*genetics;Twins",,

Subjects were categorized by those with positive fragility greater than 0% (n = 19) and those with 0% fragility (n = 21). Compared with women with 0% fragility, it was expected that women with positive fragility would have a higher likelihood of manifesting a spectrum of social and psychological disability previously shown to be associated with fragile X syndrome in women. It was also expected that within the group with positive fragility, degree of fragility would be related to severity of symptoms. Results partially supported the hypotheses: women with fragility over 0% were more likely to be assigned a diagnosis of schizotypal features, were rated higher on symptoms associated with the schizophrenia spectrum, and scored lower on IQ, level of healthiest functioning, education, and socioeconomic status than women with 0% fragility. Subsequent comparisons with a control group indicated that the group with 0% fragility and normal controls did not differ on these variables. Within the group with positive fragility, increasing fragility was related to greater severity of symptoms and lower IQ, education, socioeconomic status, and levels of adaptive functioning, as predicted. Contrary to expectations, positive fragility was not associated with proportion of affective disorder diagnoses or ratings on affective disorder symptoms.

Both genetic and hormonal factors are involved in this phenomenon. The relation between puberty and F: M ratio in CAT has never been evaluated. Methods: The F: M ratio of 133 children with CAT (group A, age at diagnosis 2.4-17.7 years) was compared with that of 113 adult CAT patients (group B, age at diagnosis 21-79 years). Group A included 64 prepubertal (aged 2.4-13.2 years, group A1) and 69 pubertal (aged 9.2-17.4, group A2) children. Results: The F: M ratio in group A was 3.0, which is significantly (p < 0.001) lower than that (10.3) found in group B patients. The F: M ratio of group A1 prepubertal children was lower (1.6) and significantly different from that of pubertal (6.7, p < 0.01) and adult patients (10.3, p < 0.0001). This phenomenon was more evident in hypothyroid as compared to euthyroid CAT. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that female predominance of CAT strongly increases during puberty, suggesting a major role for sex hormones in this phenomenon. Further studies are needed to clarify this point. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

M.",,,,,"The preimplantation bovine embryo displays sexual dimorphism in glucose sensitivity and interferon-tau (IFNT) secretion that are negated by inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway, suggesting that the association between glucose metabolism and IFNT likely underpins the selective loss of female embryos. The aim of this study was to determine if altered glucose metabolism, through glucose supplementation and/or uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation with 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), affected embryo development. Bovine blastocyst development, sex, and IFNT production were examined in embryos cultured in the presence or absence of glucose (0, 1.5, 4mM) with or without exposure to DNP (0, 10, 100M) between Days 5 and 8 post-fertilization. The absence or presence of high (4mM) glucose reduced blastocyst development and favored the development of male embryos (P<0.001). DNP at 10M had no effect, whereas 100M had a negative impact on blastocyst development. Notably, in the presence or even absence of glucose, supplementation with 10M DNP further skewed the sex ratio toward males (P<0.05). Sexually dimorphic IFNT production was maintained in these conditions, although total production was reduced in the presence of high glucose and DNP, irrespective of embryo sex. These data suggest that the pentose phosphate pathway can modulate embryonic sex ratio and development. Therefore, bovine embryo culture should be undertaken in a low glucose (<2.5mM) medium to minimize potential embryonic stress, as higher concentrations have sexually dimorphic effects on development and an embryo's ability to signal to the maternal reproductive tract.

Homology shared by Xs and Ys (and Zs and Ws) within species demonstrates that differentiated sex chromosomes were once homologous, and that the sex-specific non-recombining Y (or W) was progressively degraded. Consequently, genes are left in single copy in the heterogametic sex, which results in an imbalance of the dosage of genes on the sex chromosomes between the sexes, and also relative to the autosomes. Dosage compensation has evolved in diverse species to compensate for these dose differences, with the stringency of compensation apparently differing greatly between lineages, perhaps reflecting the concentration of genes on the original autosome pair that required dosage compensation. We discuss the organization and evolution of amniote sex chromosomes, and hypothesize that dosage insensitivity might predispose an autosome to evolving function as a sex chromosome.

This higher IFNα production in females has been suggested to contribute to sex-specific differences in the manifestations of infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE). Factors underlying these sex dimorphisms in immunity include genetics, sex hormones and exposure to environmental factors. Genetic differences between women and men are mainly due to a different distribution of chromosomes, with females possessing two X chromosomes. TLR7 escapes X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in some female pDCs, leading to biallelic expression of TLR7 in those cells. The functional consequences of TLR7 escape from XCI in pDCs remain unknown. Question: The aim of this project was to investigate on the single cell level whether pDCs with escape from XCI in TLR7 have a superior capacity of transcribing IFNα mRNA. Methods: Healthy female donors were typed for heterozygosity of the TLR7 SNP rs3853839. Freshly isolated PBMCs of heterozygous females were collected and stimulated with the TLR7/8 agonist CL097. Subsequently pDCs were isolated via FACS and cDNA of single pDCs was obtained using the Fluidigm C1 technology. The expression of mRNA with or without the SNP enabled determination of mono- or biallelic expression pattern of TLR7 within the single pDC. In the same pDCs, mRNA expression levels of TLR7, IFNα subtypes and other genes were assessed via qPCR. Results and Conclusion: Studies in three females heterozygous for TLR7 SNP rs3853839 showed that 19 - 37% of pDCs display biallelic expression of TLR7, using data from 176 single cells. The levels of TLR7 mRNA were higher in cells with biallelic compared to monoallelic TLR7 expression. In addition, multiple IFNα mRNA subtypes were expressed at higher levels in pDCs with biallelic compared to monoallelic expression of TLR7 following CL097 stimulation. These data demonstrate that on the single cell level escape from XCI can contribute to stronger IFNα transcription by female pDCs.",L631551923 2020-04-28,10.1002/eji.201970300,alpha interferon;complementary DNA;endogenous compound;messenger RNA;toll like receptor 7;adult;allele;case report;cell level;clinical article;conference abstract;female;flow cytometry;genetic association;genetic difference;genetic transcription;heterozygosity;human;human cell;male;mRNA expression level;peripheral blood mononuclear cell;plasmacytoid dendritic cell;protein expression;single nucleotide polymorphism;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;X Chromosome,,

In placental mammals, an ancient difference between males and females that may make an important contribution to GMV is the different pattern of activation of X chromosomes across cells in females (mosaic inactivation of one the two X chromosomes across cells) vs males (consistent activation of a single X chromosome in all cells). In the current study, variability in hearing thresholds was examined for human listeners with thresholds within the normal range. Initial analyses compared variability in thresholds across males vs. across females. If greater across-male than across-female variability was present, and if these differences in variability related to the different patterns X-chromosome activation in males vs. females, it was expected that correlations between related measures within a given subject (e.g., hearing thresholds at given frequency in the two ears) would be greater in males than females. METHODS: Hearing thresholds at audiometric test frequencies (500-6000 or 500-8000 Hz) were extracted from two datasets representing more than 8500 listeners with normal hearing (4590 males, 4376 females). Separate data analyses were carried out on each dataset to compare: (1) relative variability in hearing thresholds across males vs. across females at each test frequency; (2) correlations between both across-ear and within-ear hearing thresholds within  males vs. within  females, and (3) mean thresholds for females vs. males at each frequency. RESULTS: A consistent pattern of GMV in hearing thresholds was seen across frequencies in both datasets. In addition, both across-ear and within-ear correlations between thresholds were consistently greater in males than females. Previous studies have frequently reported lower mean thresholds for females than males for listeners with normal hearing. One of the datasets replicated this result, showing a clear and consistent pattern of lower mean thresholds for females. The second data set did not show clear evidence of this female advantage. CONCLUSIONS: Hearing thresholds showed clear evidence of greater variability across males than across females and higher correlations across related threshold measures within males than within females. The results support a link between the observed GMV and the mosaic pattern of X-activation for females that is not present in males.",L639046825 2022-09-23,10.1186/s13293-022-00457-9,auditory threshold;female;hearing;human;male;physiology;placenta;pregnancy;sexual characteristics;X chromosome;X Chromosome;Sex Characteristics,,

S. and Nanjundiah, V.",,,,,"We explore three possible pathways for the evolution of genomic imprinting. (1) Imprinting may be advantageous in itself when imprinted and unimprinted alleles of a locus confer different phenotypes. If a segment of DNA is imprinted in the gametes of one sex but not in those of the other, it might lead to effects correlated with sexual dimorphism. More fundamentally, in certain organisms, sex determination might have evolved because of imprinting. When imprinting leads to chromosome elimination or inactivation and occurs in some embryos but not in others, two classes of embryos, differing in the number of functional gene copies, would result. A model for sex determination based on inequality in the actual or effective copy-number of particular noncoding, regulatory sequences of DNA has been proposed (Chandra, Proc. natn. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82. 1165-1169 and 6947-6949, 1985). Maternal control of offspring sex is another possible consequence of imprinting; this would indicate a potential role for imprinting in sex ratio evolution. (2) Genes responsible for imprinting may have pleiotropic effects and they may have been selected for reasons other than their imprinting ability. Lack of evidence precludes further consideration of this possibility. (3) Imprinting could have co-evolved with other traits. For instance, gamete-specific imprinting could lead to a lowered fitness of androgenetic or gynogenetic diploids relative to the fitness of 'normal' diploids. This in turn would reinforce the evolution of anisogamy. The reversibility of imprinting raises the possibility of occasional incomplete or improper erasure. If the site of imprinting is the egg - as appears to be the case with the human X (Chandra and Brown, Nature 253. 165-168, 1975)- either improper imprinting or improper erasure could lead to unusual patterns of inheritance (as in the fragile-X syndrome) or fitness effects skipping generations.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 14 Total Times Cited: 16 Cited Reference Count: 39,,x-inactivation;mealybugs;evolution of sex;anisogamy;mammalian x-chromosome;methylation;origin;mice;inactivation;inheritance;gamete;Genomics;Genome,,

Research using animal models has convincingly shown that sex differences in the brain and behavior are induced by sex hormones during a specific, hormone-sensitive period during early development. Thus, male-typical psychosexual characteristics seem to develop under the influence of testosterone, mostly acting during early development. By contrast, female-typical psychosexual characteristics may actually be organized under the influence of estradiol during a specific prepubertal period. The sexual differentiation of the human brain also seems to proceed predominantly under the influence of sex hormones. Recent studies using magnetic resonance imaging have shown that several sexually differentiated aspects of brain structure and function are female-typical in women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46 XY karyotype but a female phenotype due to complete androgen resistance, suggesting that these sex differences most likely reflect androgen action, although feminizing effects of estrogens or female-typical socialization cannot be ruled out. By contrast, some male-typical neural characteristics were also observed in women with CAIS suggesting direct effects of sex chromosome genes in the sexual differentiation of the human brain.

Birds have a very conserved ZW system of sex determination in which males have two copies of a large, gene-rich Z chromosome, and females have a single Z and a female-specific W chromosome. The avian ZW system is quite the reverse of the well-studied mammalian XY chromosome system, and evolved independently from different autosomal blocs. Despite the different gene content of mammal and bird sex chromosomes, there are many parallels. Genes on the bird Z and the mammal X have both undergone selection for male-advantage functions, and there has been amplification of male-advantage genes and accumulation of LINEs. The bird W and mammal Y have both undergone extensive degradation, but some birds retain early stages and some mammals terminal stages of the process, suggesting that the process is more advanced in mammals. Different sex-determining genes, DMRT1 and SRY, define the ZW and XY systems, but DMRT1 is involved in downstream events in mammals. Birds show strong cell autonomous specification of somatic sex differences in ZZ and ZW tissue, but there is growing evidence for direct X chromosome effects on sexual phenotype in mammals. Dosage compensation in birds appears to be phenotypically and molecularly quite different from X inactivation, being partial and gene-specific, but both systems use tools from the same molecular toolbox and there are some signs that galliform birds represent an early stage in the evolution of a coordinated system.","1573-6849 Graves, Jennifer A Marshall Journal Article Review Netherlands 2014/03/07 Chromosome Res. 2014 Apr;22(1):45-57. doi: 10.1007/s10577-014-9409-9.",10.1007/s10577-014-9409-9,"Animals;Birds/*genetics;Dosage Compensation, Genetic/*genetics;*Evolution, Molecular;Female;In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence;Male;*Phenotype;*Sex;Sex Chromosomes/*genetics;Sex Determination Processes/*genetics;Species Specificity;Transcription Factors/genetics;Sex Chromosomes;Genomics;Genome",,

Recently, we successfully identified a strong candidate gene at the top of the sex determination cascade in B. mori. This gene was termed Feminizer (Fem) and revealed to be a source of Fem-piRNA. Further, we found that B. mori doublesex (Bmdsx) splicing was markedly altered to produce the male-type isoform when a Fem-piRNA inhibitor was injected into ZW embryos. Moreover, knockdown of Masculinizer (Masc), a Fem-piRNA target gene, altered to produce the female-type isoform of Bmdsx in male embryos. However, it remains unclear as to whether Masc directly regulates the sex-specific expression of Bmdsx. In previous studies, we determined that the male-specific isoform of the Bombyx homolog of IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (Imp(M)) was involved in the male-specific splicing of Bmdsx. In an attempt to clarify the genetic relationship between Fem, Masc, Imp(M), and Bmdsx, knockdown experiments were performed. Knockdown of Fem shifted into male-type Bmdsx, Imp(M) and Masc in female embryos. Knockdown of Masc led to the production of the female-type Bmdsx and a dramatic reduction in Imp(M) expression in male embryos. Knockdown of ImpM shifted Bmdsx splice mode from the male-type into the female-type. Our results suggest that: (1) Fem reduces Masc expression, (2) Masc dramatically induces Imp(M) expression, and (3) Imp(M) shifting Bmdsx splice mode from the female-type into the male-type.

This variation is expected to affect the laboratory detection of the hemophilia A (HA) heterozygotes in addition to the X-inactivation-dependent mosaicism and the type of deficient mutant present in a given pedigree. The Sardinian pedigrees yielded 13 new cases of nonrecombinants between the loci for HA and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), as well as four nonrecombinants between HA and Deutan color blindness. These findings bring to a total of 58 the number of scorable sibs and nonrecombinants thus far known for the linkage HA-G6PD. From such a figure it has been possible to infer that the 90% upper limit of meiotic recombination between the two loci is below 4%, thus justifying the application of the 'linkage diagnostic test' for the detection of HA heterozygotes and the prenatal diagnosis of the hemophilic fetuses in families that segregate at both loci. In three out of the five HA pedigrees of our series that segregate also for G6PD or Deutan color blindness, the observed segregation of the combined phenotypes can be best explained by assuming the occurrence of a fresh mutation in the maternal grandfather.

Studies which illuminate potential causes underlying this sex difference and characteristic onset during the reproductive years have the potential to fundamentally advance our understanding of disease pathogenesis in SLE. Similarly, progress in this area will likely inform human reproductive immunology. Studies of sex hormone function in the immune system are of obvious importance; however, it seems likely that many other types of sex-related genetic and immunological differences will contribute to SLE. In this review, we will focus on recent work in sex-related differences in cytokine pathways and genetics of these pathways as they relate to SLE pathogenesis. It seems quite possible that many of these sex-related differences could be important to reproductive fitness, which may explain the conservation of these immune system features and the observed female predominance of SLE.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 134 Total Times Cited: 141 Cited Reference Count: 72,10.1007/s12016-009-8192-4,"Systemic lupus erythematosus;Sex;Cytokines;Genetics;X chromosome;Interferon alpha;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;INTERFERON-ALPHA ACTIVITY;IFN-ALPHA;DISEASE-ACTIVITY;I INTERFERON;TLR7 GENE;OSTEOPONTIN;CELLS;MICROCHIMERISM;PATHOGENESIS;Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic",,

Coccids show sex-specific heterochromatization of an entire set of chromosomes and transcriptional silencing of all the paternally contributed chromosomes in males. Thus, genomic imprinting and the resultant differential regulation operate on 50% of the genome in contrast to the single X chromosome in female mammals. A significant insight into the phenomenon of genomic imprinting has come from very elegant cytological analysis of the coccid system. Recently, efforts have been made to dissect out at the molecular level the phenomenon of genomic imprinting in these insects. The present review summarizes both of these aspects. In light of the accruing experimental evidence for chromatin-based differences in the maternal and paternal genomes, it appears that the mealybug system may provide evidence for stable maintenance of chromatin code not only through mitosis but also through meiosis.

The child was a phenotypically normal female with normal karyotype. Her father had no clinical or biochemical signs of haemophilia A. RFLP-analysis using DX13 and St14 probes each elicited one allele (5.8 and 3.4 kb, respectively) segregating along with the affected F VIII gene from the hemizygous grandfather to both his daughters and further to the haemophilic female child. The paternity of the child was analyzed using various red cell and HLA antigens and RFLP by p29C, a probe detecting polymorphic hypervariable TaqI and PstI fragments in the pseudoautosomal areas of the X- and Y-chromosomes. All results obtained were concordant with the declared paternity. RFLP-analysis, using single (Pst I) and double digestion (Pst I/Hha I) of DNA and a PGK probe, revealed a remarkable difference in hybridization fragments, strongly suggesting hypermethylation, and in consequence, preferential X-chromosome inactivation in the proposita.

Following X inactivation in females, the Y chromosome is the major genetic difference between sexes. In this study, we used a male embryonic stem cell line (Royan H6) to identify the potential role of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) during spontaneous differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs) as a model of early embryonic development. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, RH6 cells were cultured on inactivated feeder layers and Matrigel. In a dynamic suspension system, aggregates were generated in the same size and were spontaneously differentiated into EBs. During differentiation, expression patterns of specific markers for three germ layers were compared with MSY genes. Results: Spontaneous differentiation was determined by downregulation of pluripotent markers and upregulation of fourteen differentiation markers. Upregulation of the ectoderm markers was observed on days 4 and 16, whereas mesoderm markers were upregulated on the 8th day and endodermic markers on days 12-16. Mesoderm markers correlated with 8 MSY genes namely DDX3Y, RPS4Y1, KDM5D, TBL1Y, BCORP1, PRY, DAZ, and AMELY, which were classified as a mesoderm cluster. Endoderm markers were co-expressed with 7 MSY genes, i.e. ZFY, TSPY, PRORY, VCY, EIF1AY, USP9Y, and RPKY, which were grouped as an endoderm cluster. Finally, the ectoderm markers correlated with TXLNGY, NLGN4Y, PCDH11Y, TMSB4Y, UTY, RBMY1, and HSFY genes of the MSY, which were categorized as an ectoderm cluster. In contrast, 2 MSY genes, SRY and TGIF2LY, were more highly expressed in RH6 cells compared to EBs. Conclusion: We found a significant correlation between spontaneous differentiation and upregulation of specific MSY genes. The expression alterations of MSY genes implied the potential responsibility of their gene co-expression clusters for EB differentiation. We suggest that these genes may play important roles in early embryonic development.",L2011891664 2021-05-27 2021-08-20,10.22074/cellj.2021.7145,polymerase chain reaction system;amely gene;article;bcorp1 gene;cell differentiation;daz gene;ddx3y gene;down regulation;ectoderm;eif1ay gene;embryo;embryo development;embryoid body;endoderm;feeder cell;gene;gene expression;genetic marker;hsfy gene;human;human cell;human embryonic stem cell;in vitro study;in vivo study;kdm5d gene;male;mesoderm;nlgn4y gene;pcdh11y gene;prory gene;pry gene;rbmy1 gene;rpky gene;rps4y1 gene;SRY gene;tbl1y gene;tgif2ly gene;tmsb4y gene;tspy gene;txlngy gene;upregulation;usp9y gene;uty gene;vcy gene;Y chromosome;zfy gene;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

The activity of the enzyme is substantially elevated in placental syncytiotrophoblasts and is lower in other somatic cells. The polypeptide sequence of the enzyme is encoded by a gene located on the distal short arm of the human X chromosome. Prior studies have shown that the STS gene escapes X-chromosome inactivation. We studied the expression of the STS gene in primary cultures of cytotrophoblasts from human term placentae and compared it with the expression of autosomally encoded placental alkaline phosphatase (PALP) and X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). During 90 h in culture, the mononucleated cytotrophoblast cells did not proliferate, but differentiated into multinucleated, syncytiotrophoblast-like cells. STS activity in freshly isolated cytotrophoblasts was low (about 17%), compared to placental tissue, and about 1.7-fold higher in female than in male cells. During cultivation, STS activity increased 2- to 3-fold in female, but not in male, cells. PALP activity was very low in freshly isolated cytotrophoblasts (about 5% of placental tissue), and no significant difference between female and male cells was detectable. Within 90 h in culture, PALP activity increased in all preparations about 2- to 4-fold. G6PD activity in freshly isolated cytotrophoblasts showed great variation among preparations, and no significant difference between female and male cells was detectable. In both male and female cells the activity declined to about 50% of initial activity during cultivation. We conclude that human cytotrophoblasts in primary culture show a sex-specific regulation of STS activity, perhaps as a unique feature of the STS gene.

Its main role is to facilitate gene expression through removal of the repressive H3K27me3 mark, with evidence of some additional histone demethylase-independent functions. KDM6A mutations have been implicated in congenital disorders such as Kabuki Syndrome, as well as in sex differences in cancer. METHODS: Kdm6a was knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in F1 male and female mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) derived from reciprocal crosses between C57BL6 x Mus castaneus. Diploid and allelic RNA-seq analyses were done to compare gene expression between wild-type and Kdm6a knockout (KO) clones. The effects of Kdm6a KO on sex-biased gene expression were investigated by comparing gene expression between male and female ES cells. Changes in H3K27me3 enrichment and chromatin accessibility at promoter regions of genes with expression changes were characterized by ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq followed by diploid and allelic analyses. RESULTS: We report that Kdm6a KO in male and female embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from F1 hybrid mice cause extensive gene dysregulation, disruption of sex biases, and specific parental allele effects. Among the dysregulated genes are candidate genes that may explain abnormal developmental features of Kabuki syndrome caused by KDM6A mutations in human. Strikingly, Kdm6a knockouts result in a decrease in sex-biased expression and in preferential downregulation of the maternal alleles of a number of genes. Most promoters of dysregulated genes show concordant epigenetic changes including gain of H3K27me3 and loss of chromatin accessibility, but there was less concordance when considering allelic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals new sex-related roles of KDM6A in the regulation of developmental genes, the maintenance of sex-biased gene expression, and the differential expression of parental alleles.",L638567147 2022-08-01 2022-08-03,10.1186/s13293-022-00452-0,"histone;histone demethylase;allele;animal;chromatin;face;female;genetics;hematologic disease;human;male;metabolism;mouse;multiple malformation syndrome;vestibular disorder;Genes, Regulator;Alleles",,

In many organisms, dosage compensation has thus evolved to equalize sex-linked gene expression in males and females. In mammals this is achieved by X chromosome inactivation and in flies and worms by up- or down-regulation of X-linked expression, respectively. While otherwise widespread in systems with heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the case of dosage compensation in birds (males ZZ, females ZW) remains an unsolved enigma. RESULTS: Here, we use a microarray approach to show that male chicken embryos generally express higher levels of Z-linked genes than female birds, both in soma and in gonads. The distribution of male-to-female fold-change values for Z chromosome genes is wide and has a mean of 1.4-1.6, which is consistent with absence of dosage compensation and sex-specific feedback regulation of gene expression at individual loci. Intriguingly, without global dosage compensation, the female chicken has significantly lower expression levels of Z-linked compared to autosomal genes, which is not the case in male birds. CONCLUSION: The pronounced sex difference in gene expression is likely to contribute to sexual dimorphism among birds, and potentially has implication to avian sex determination. Importantly, this report, together with a recent study of sex-biased expression in somatic tissue of chicken, demonstrates the first example of an organism with a lack of global dosage compensation, providing an unexpected case of a viable system with large-scale imbalance in gene expression between sexes.","1741-7007 Ellegren, Hans Hultin-Rosenberg, Lina Brunström, Björn Dencker, Lennart Kultima, Kim Scholz, Birger Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2007/09/22 BMC Biol. 2007 Sep 20;5:40. doi: 10.1186/1741-7007-5-40.",10.1186/1741-7007-5-40,"Animals;Chick Embryo;Chickens/*genetics;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Female;*Gene Expression;*Genes, X-Linked;Male;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Sex Characteristics;Socioeconomic Factors;Chickens",,

Evidence shows that many sex-specific diseases have their basis in X chromosome biology. While female schizophrenia patients often have a delayed age of disease onset and clinical phenotypes that are different from those of males, it is unknown whether the sex differences in schizophrenia are associated with X-linked gene dosage and the choice of X chromosome silencing in female cells. Previous studies demonstrated that sex chromosome aneuploidies may be related to the pathogeneses of some psychiatric diseases. Here, we examined the changes in skewed XCI in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: A total of 109 female schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and 80 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (CNTLs) were included in this study. We evaluated clinical features including disease onset age, disease duration, clinical symptoms by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and antipsychotic treatment dosages. The XCI skewing patterns were analyzed by the methylation profile of the HUMARA gene found in DNA isolated from SCZ patient and CNTL leukocytes in the three age groups. RESULTS: First, we found that the frequency of skewed XCI in SCZ patients was 4 times more than that in the age- and sex-matched CNTLs (p < 0.01). Second, we found an earlier onset of severe XCI skewing in the SCZ patients than in CNTLs. Third, we demonstrated a close relationship between the severity of skewed XCI and schizophrenic symptoms (PANSS score ≥ 90) as well as the age of disease onset. Fourth, we demonstrated that the skewed XCI in SCZ patients was not transmitted from the patients' mothers. LIMITATIONS: The XCI skewing pattern might differ depending on tissues or organs. Although this is the first study to explore skewed XCI in SCZ, in the future, samples from different tissues or cells in SCZ patients might be important for understanding the impact of skewed XCI in this disease. CONCLUSION: Our study, for the first time, investigated skewed XCI in female SCZ patients and presented a potential mechanism for the sex differences in SCZ. Our data also suggested that XCI might be a potential target for the development of female-specific interventions for SCZ.",L632387448 2020-07-28,10.1186/s13293-020-00315-6,adolescent;adult;aged;aging;case control study;child;female;genetic predisposition;genetics;human;middle aged;schizophrenia;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;young adult;Schizophrenia;X Chromosome,,

Conversely, environmental conditions experienced in early life can dramatically influence neonatal and adult biology, which may result in detrimental long-term effects. Several studies have shown that small size at birth, which is associated with a greater risk of metabolic syndrome, is largely determined before the formation of the blastocysts because 70%-80% of variation in bodyweight at birth has neither a genetic nor environmental component. In addition, it has been reported that adult bodyweight is programmed by energy-dependent process during the pronuclear stage in the mouse. Although the early embryo has a high developmental plasticity and adapts and survives to adverse environmental conditions, this adaptation may have adverse consequences and there is strong evidence that in vitro culture can be a risk factor for abnormal fetal outcomes in animals systems, with growing data suggesting that a similar link may be apparent for humans. In this context, male and female preimplantation embryos display sex-specific transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, which, in the case of bovine blastocysts, expands to one-third of the transcripts detected through microarray analysis. This sex-specific bias may convert the otherwise buffered stochastic variability in developmental networks in a sex-determined response to the environmental hazard. It has been widely reported that environment can affect preimplantation development in a sex-specific manner, resulting in either a short-term sex ratio adjustment or in long-term sex-specific effects on adult health. The present article reviews current knowledge about the natural phenotypic variation caused by epigenetic mechanisms and the mechanisms modulating sex-specific changes in phenotype during early embryo development resulting in sex ratio adjustments or detrimental sex-specific consequences for adult health. Understanding the natural embryo sexual dimorphism for programming trajectories will help understand the early mechanisms of response to environmental insults. © 2013 IETS.",L368001745 2013-01-03 2013-01-14,10.1071/rd12262,DNA methyltransferase;sex hormone;article;birth weight;blastocyst;cell division;DNA methylation;DNA strand;embryo development;embryo transfer;environmental factor;epigenetics;fetus development;human;in vitro study;in vivo study;infertility therapy;low birth weight;microarray analysis;nonhuman;perinatal mortality;perinatal period;phenotype;phenotypic plasticity;phenotypic variation;preimplantation embryo;premature labor;prenatal development;retroposon;sex determination;sex difference;sex ratio;small for date infant;spermatozoon;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Phenotype,,

We studied several immune functions depending on X-linked genes in healthy adults of both sexes: the respiratory burst of purified neutrophils, the CD99 and CD11b expression of stimulated leukocytes as markers of adhesion and diapedesis, and the production of inflammatory cytokines in whole blood after incubation with lipopolysaccharide for 24 h. The percentage of monocytes expressing CD99 was higher in men than in women, thus confirming the higher CD99 expression reported in males using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, we observed a higher tumor necrosis factor alpha and tendency toward higher interleukin (IL) 6 production in men after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. These differences may contribute to the higher mortality reported in men with septic shock. Tumor necrosis factor a production significantly correlated with monocyte count, with men having a higher monocyte count than women. When cytokine levels were normalized to monocyte counts, a higher IL-8 production was found in women, which may explain the higher neutrophil count observed in girls with acute inflammatory diseases, because IL-8 is a major neutrophil chemoattractant. These sex differences regarding the activation of certain X-linked genes involved in innate immunity confirm our clinical observations, thus supporting the role of sex chromosomes in inflammatory response.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 40 Total Times Cited: 40 Cited Reference Count: 35,10.1097/SHK.0b013e3182571e46,Sex;inflammation;Toll-like receptor;endotoxin;diapedesis;tumor necrosis factor alpha;interleukin 8;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;SEVERELY BURNED CHILDREN;GENDER-DIFFERENCES;CELLULAR MOSAICISM;AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE;THERMAL BURNS;SEPSIS;MORTALITY;TRAUMA;SHOCK;Sex Characteristics;Cytokines;Lipopolysaccharides,,

Gonadal hormones are a major determinant of these sex differences. However, sex differences in body size and composition are evident prior to exposure to gonadal hormones, providing evidence for gonadal-independent contributions attributable to the XX or XY sex chromosome complement. Large-scale genetic studies have revealed male/female differences in the genetic architecture of adipose tissue amount and anatomical distribution. However, these studies have typically neglected the X and Y chromosomes. Scope of the review: Here we discuss how the sex chromosome complement may influence obesity, lipid levels, and inflammation. Human sex chromosome anomalies such as Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), as well as mouse models with engineered alterations in sex chromosome complement, support an important role for sex chromosomes in obesity and metabolism. In particular, the Four Core Genotypes mouse model—consisting of XX mice with either ovaries or testes, and XY mice with either ovaries or testes—has revealed an effect of X chromosome dosage on adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation irrespective of male or female gonads. Mechanisms may include enhanced expression of genes that escape X chromosome inactivation. Major conclusions: Although less well studied than effects of gonadal hormones, sex chromosomes exert independent and interactive effects on adiposity, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. In particular, the presence of two X chromosomes has been associated with increased adiposity and dyslipidemia in mouse models and in XXY men. The enhanced expression of genes that escape X chromosome inactivation may contribute, but more work is required.",L2000709809 2018-05-08 2018-07-27,10.1016/j.molmet.2018.04.003,"microRNA;sex hormone;adipose tissue;fat mass;gene;gene expression;genome-wide association study;genotype;gonad;human;hyperlipidemia;inflammation;karyotype 46,XX;Klinefelter syndrome;lipid level;lipid metabolism;lipid storage;non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;nonhuman;obesity;ovary;priority journal;review;sex chromosome;sex difference;SRY gene;testis;Turner syndrome;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;Sex Characteristics;Lipid Metabolism;Sex Chromosomes;Inflammation;Obesity",,

Analyses using a combination of gene expression data, ENCODE data, and evolutionary data of sex-biased gene expression in human tissues can give insight into the regulatory and evolutionary forces acting on sex-biased genes. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes between males and females. On the X chromosome, we used a novel method and investigated the status of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation (escape genes), taking into account the clonality of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). To investigate the regulation of sex-biased differentially expressed genes (sDEG), we conducted pathway and transcription factor enrichment analyses on the sDEGs, as well as analyses on the genomic distribution of sDEGs. Evolutionary analyses were also conducted on both sDEGs and escape genes. RESULTS: Genome-wide, we characterized differential gene expression between sexes in 462 RNA-seq samples and identified 587 sex-biased genes, or 3.2% of the genes surveyed. On the X chromosome, sDEGs were distributed in evolutionary strata in a similar pattern as escape genes. We found a trend of negative correlation between the gene expression breadth and nonsynonymous over synonymous mutation (dN/dS) ratios, showing a possible pleiotropic constraint on evolution of genes. Genome-wide, nine transcription factors were found enriched in binding to the regions surrounding the transcription start sites of female-biased genes. Many pathways and protein domains were enriched in sex-biased genes, some of which hint at sex-biased physiological processes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings lend insight into the regulatory and evolutionary forces shaping sex-biased gene expression and their involvement in the physiological and pathological processes in human health and diseases.",L622786523 2018-07-03,10.1186/s13293-017-0156-4,female;gene expression;gene expression regulation;human;human genome;male;molecular evolution;sexual characteristics;X chromosomal inheritance;X Chromosome,,

This is also true for the differences between men and women concerning sexual orientation. Sexual differentiation is mediated by three groups of biological mechanisms: early actions of sex steroids, more direct actions of sex-specific genes not mediated by gonadal sex steroids and epigenetic mechanisms. Differential interactions with parents and conspecifics have additionally long-term influences on behavior. This presentation reviews available evidence indicating that these different mechanisms play a significant role in the control of sexual partner preference in animals and humans, in other words the homosexual versus heterosexual orientation. Clinical and epidemiological studies of phenotypically selected populations indicate that early actions of hormones and genetic factors clearly contribute to the determination of sexual orientation. The maternal embryonic environment also modifies the incidence of male homosexuality via immunological mechanisms. The relative contribution of each of these mechanisms remains however to be determined.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 12 Total Times Cited: 12 Cited Reference Count: 188,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.03.024,Homosexuality;Biological mechanisms;Sexual differentiation;Testosterone;Organizing effects of steroids;Twin concordance;Genome-wide associations;Older brother effect;Fraternal birth order effect;DIGIT-LENGTH RATIOS;CONGENITAL ADRENAL-HYPERPLASIA;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;PRENATAL STRESS;CLOACAL EXSTROPHY;ANDROGEN RECEPTOR;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;ANTERIOR HYPOTHALAMUS;OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS;PUTATIVE PHEROMONES;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Animal Shells;Animals;Sexual Partners,,

This hypothesis relates to nonsyndromic or essential autismwith an extremely highmale/female (M/F) ratio in infantswho are genetically normal except for common or lowpenetrance genetic variants. The hypothesiswas suggested by the discovery of TMLHE deficiency as an inborn error of carnitine biosynthesis in families with non-dysmorphic autismand the suggestion that TMLHE deficiency is a risk factor for nonsyndromic autism. The extremely high M/F ratio in a major subset of autism strongly suggests somemore homogeneous etiology for 10-20% of autism and provides a stimulus to understand the basis of the sex difference. We searched for a carnitine-related mechanism to explain the sex ratio, and found that the SLC6A14 protein is an amino acid/carnitine transporter functioning at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The human/mouse SLC6A14/Slc6a14 genes are located on the X chromosome and lack differentialmethylation on the inactive X chromosome suggesting escape from X-inactivation. Methods: We measured transport of radioactive carnitine across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after tail vein injection in mice. Mice were sacrificed four hours after injection and radioactive carnitine in the brain was quantitated by scintillation counting. Results: Transport of radioactive carnitine across the BBBwas greater in femalemice compared tomalemice likely due to lack of X-inactivation of Slc6a14. Transport of radioactive carnitine across the BBB was reduced in female and male Slc6a14 null mice compared to wild-type mice. Conclusions:We interpret the Slc6a14-mediated sex difference in transport of carnitine across the BBB as consistentwith the hypothesis that brain carnitine deficiency can cause autism.We hypothesize that human female infants transport carnitine across the BBBmore readily thanmale infants.

Thus, mutations associated with neuropsychiatric conditions may result in sexually dimorphic symptoms by acting on different neural substrates or chromatin landscapes in males and females. Finally, as stress hormone signaling may directly alter the molecular machinery that interacts with sex hormone receptors to regulate gene expression, the contribution of chronic stress to the pathogenesis or presentation of mental illness may be additionally different between the sexes.

These parent-of-origin (PoO) effects have not yet been explored on the X chromosome, which motivated us to develop new methods for detecting such effects. Orofacial clefts (OFCs) exhibit sex-specific differences in prevalence and are examples of traits where a search for various types of effects on the X chromosome might be relevant. Materials and Methods: We upgraded our R-package Haplin to enable genome-wide analyses of PoO effects, as well as power simulations for different statistical models. 14,486 X-chromosome SNPs in 1,291 Asian and 1,118 European case-parent triads of isolated OFCs were available from a previous GWAS. For each ethnicity, cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate only (CPO) were analyzed separately using two X-inactivation models and a sliding-window approach to haplotype analysis. In addition, we performed analyses restricted to female offspring. Results: Associations were identified in ""Dystrophin"" (DMD, Xp21.2-p21.1), ""Fibroblast growth factor 13"" (FGF13, Xq26.3-q27.1) and ""EGF-like domain multiple 6"" (EGFL6, Xp22.2), with biologically plausible links to OFCs. Unlike EGFL6, the other associations on chromosomal region Xp22.2 had no apparent connections to OFCs. However, the Xp22.2 region itself is of potential interest because it contains genes for clefting syndromes [for example, ""Oral-facial-digital syndrome 1"" (OFD1) and ""Midline 1"" (MID1)]. Overall, the identified associations were highly specific for ethnicity, cleft subtype and X-inactivation model, except for DMD in which associations were identified in both CPO and CL/P, in the model with X-inactivation and in Europeans only. Discussion/Conclusion: The specificity of the associations for ethnicity, cleft subtype and X-inactivation model underscores the utility of conducting subanalyses, despite the ensuing need to adjust for additional multiple testing. Further investigations are needed to confirm the associations with DMD, EGF16, and FGF13. Furthermore, chromosomal region Xp22.2 appears to be a hotspot for genes implicated in clefting syndromes and thus constitutes an exciting direction to pursue in future OFCs research. More generally, the new methods presented here are readily adaptable to the study of X-linked PoO effects in other outcomes that use a family-based design.","1664-8021 Skare, Øivind Lie, Rolv T Haaland, Øystein A Gjerdevik, Miriam Romanowska, Julia Gjessing, Håkon K Jugessur, Astanand Journal Article Switzerland 2018/03/10 Front Genet. 2018 Feb 22;9:25. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2018.00025. eCollection 2018.",10.3389/fgene.2018.00025,Gwas;Haplin;X chromosome;birth defects;case-parent triads;genetic epidemiology;orofacial clefts;parent-of-origin;X Chromosome,,

Epidemiological and genetic studies suggest a female protective effect (FPE) may account for part of this bias; however, the mechanism of such protection is unknown. Quantitative assessment of ASD symptoms using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) shows a bimodal distribution unique to females in multiplex families. This leads to the hypothesis that a single, common genetic locus on chromosome X might mediate the FPE and produce the ASD sex bias. Such a locus would represent a major therapeutic target and is likely to have been missed by conventional genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis. METHODS: To explore this possibility, we performed an association study in affected versus unaffected females, considering three tiers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as follows: 1) regions of chromosome X that escape X-inactivation, 2) all of chromosome X, and 3) genome-wide. RESULTS: No evidence of a SNP meeting the criteria for a single FPE locus was observed, despite the analysis being well powered to detect this effect.

P. and Bourdeau, H. A. and Gubish, C. T. and Tirpak, D. L. and Davis, A. L. and Luketich, J. D. and Siegfried, J. M.",,,,,"BACKGROUND: Activation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) in human airways has been associated with a proliferative response of bronchial cells to gastrin-releasing peptide and with long-term tobacco use. The GRPR gene is located on the X chromosome and escapes X-chromosome inactivation, which occurs in females. Increasing evidence demonstrates that women are more susceptible than men to tobacco carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that the susceptibility of women to the effects of tobacco may be associated with airway expression of GRPR. METHODS: We analyzed GRPR messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in lung tissues and cultured airway cells from 78 individuals (40 males and 38 females) and in lung fibroblasts exposed to nicotine in vitro. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in airway cells were assayed by use of radioactively labeled nicotine and nicotine antagonists. A polymorphism in exon 2 of the GRPR gene was used to detect allele-specific GRPR mRNA expression in some individuals. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: GRPR mRNA expression was detected in airway cells and tissues of more female than male nonsmokers (55% versus 0%) and short-term smokers (1-25 pack-years [pack-years = number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years of smoking]) (75% versus 20%) (P =.018 for nonsmoking and short-term smoking females versus nonsmoking and short-term smoking males). Female smokers exhibited expression of GRPR mRNA at a lower mean pack-year exposure than male smokers (37.4 pack-years versus 56.3 pack-years; P =.037). Lung fibroblasts and bronchial epithelial cells exhibited high-affinity, saturable nicotinic acetylcholine-binding sites. Expression of GRPR mRNA in lung fibroblasts was elevated following exposure to nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the GRPR gene is expressed more frequently in women than in men in the absence of smoking and that expression of this gene is activated earlier in women in response to tobacco exposure. The presence of two expressed copies of the GRPR gene in females may be a factor in the increased susceptibility of women to tobacco-induced lung cancer.","Shriver, S P Bourdeau, H A Gubish, C T Tirpak, D L Davis, A L Luketich, J D Siegfried, J M CA50694/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

Mitochondrial maintenance failure may result from trade-offs between mitochondrial turnover versus growth and reproduction, sexual antagonistic pleiotropy and genetic conflicts resulting from uni-parental mitochondrial transmission, as well as mitochondrial and nuclear mutations and loss of epigenetic regulation. Aging phenotypes and interventions are often sex-specific, indicating that both male and female sexual differentiation promote mitochondrial failure and aging. Studies in mammals and invertebrates implicate autophagy, apoptosis, AKT, PARP, p53 and FOXO in mediating sex-specific differences in stress resistance and aging. The data support a model where the genes Sxl in Drosophila, sdc-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans, and Xist in mammals regulate mitochondrial maintenance across generations and in aging. Several interventions that increase life span cause a mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), and UPRmt is also observed during normal aging, indicating hormesis. The UPRmt may increase life span by stimulating mitochondrial turnover through autophagy, and/or by inhibiting the production of hormones and toxic metabolites.

Maternal inheritance occurs infrequently, with surviving progeny showing intrauterine growth retardation and reduced fertility. Transmission ratio distortion results from disrupted imprinting and postimplantation loss of mutant embryos. In contrast to effects in embryonic stem cells, deleting Tsix causes ectopic X inactivation in early male embryos and inactivation of both X chromosomes in female embryos, indicating that X chromosome counting cannot override Tsix imprinting.

The mechanisms leading to sex biased disease prevalence are not well understood. However, for adult-onset autoimmune disease, at least some of the cause is usually ascribed to sex hormones. This is because levels of sex hormones are one of the most obvious physiological differences between adult males and females, and their impact on immune system function is well recognised. While for paediatric-onset autoimmune diseases a sex bias is not as common, there are several such diseases for which one sex predominates. For example, the oligoarticular subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) occurs in approximately three times more girls than boys, with a peak age of onset well before the onset of puberty, and at a time when levels of androgen and oestrogen are low and not strikingly different between the sexes. Here, we review potential explanations for autoimmune disease sex bias with a particular focus on paediatric autoimmune disease, and biological mechanisms outside of sex hormone differences.",L608922858 2016-04-21 2016-05-05,10.1016/j.jaut.2016.02.011,sex hormone;autoimmune disease;childhood disease;epigenetics;gender bias;genetic risk;genetics;human;immune response;priority journal;review;sexually dimorphic immune response;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;Autoimmune Diseases;Bias (Epidemiology);Autoimmunity,,

Ultimately, sex differences in healthy individuals, or in pathological states, must arise as a consequence of the differential complement of sex-linked genes in males and females. These genes may act indirectly (for example through influencing gonadal hormone secretion), or directly, to influence brain development and function. In this review, I discuss how genetically tractable mouse models may be employed to inform our knowledge of the molecular basis of sexual differentiation of the mammalian brain, and how such models may therefore represent a useful tool through which to identify risk factors predisposing to sex-biased neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",L51542452 2011-07-29 2013-04-04,10.1016/j.brainresbull.2011.06.018,catechol methyltransferase;animal behavior;behavior disorder;brain function;disease model;gene function;genetic association;genotype;haploinsufficiency;human;mental disease;mouse mutant;neurologic disease;nonhuman;priority journal;review;sex difference;sex differentiation;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;Brain;Mice,,

In the most classic scenario, one sex is characterized by a homologue pair of sex chromosomes, while the other includes two morphologically and functionally distinct gonosomes. In mammalian diploid cells, the female is characterized by the presence of two identical X chromosomes, while the male features an XY pair, with the Y bearing the major genetic determinant of sex, i.e. the SRY gene. In other species, such as the fruitfly, sex is determined by the ratio of autosomes to X chromosomes. Regardless of the exact mechanism, however, all these animals would exhibit a sex-specific gene expression inequality, due to the different number of X chromosomes, a phenomenon inhibited by a series of genetic and epigenetic regulatory events described as ""dosage compensation"". Since adequate available data is currently restricted to worms, flies and mammals, while for other groups of animals, such as reptiles, fish and birds it is very limited, it is not yet clear whether this is an evolutionary conserved mechanism. However certain striking similarities have already been observed among evolutionary distant species, such as Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus. These mainly refer to a) the need for a counting mechanism, to determine the chromosomal content of the cell, i.e. the ratio of autosomes to gonosomes (a process well understood in flies, but still hypothesized in mammals), b) the implication of non-translated, sex-specific, regulatory RNAs (roX and Xist, respectively) as key elements in this process and the location of similar mediators in the Z chromosome of chicken c) the inclusion of a chromatin modification epigenetic final step, which ensures that gene expression remains stably regulated throughout the affected area of the gonosome. This review summarizes these points and proposes a possible role for comparative genetics, as they seem to constitute proof of maintained cell economy (by using the same basic regulatory elements in various different scenarios) throughout numerous centuries of evolutionary history.","1477-7827 Angelopoulou, Roxani Lavranos, Giagkos Manolakou, Panagiota Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review England 2008/03/22 Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2008 Mar 20;6:12. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-6-12.",10.1186/1477-7827-6-12,"Animals;*Biological Evolution;Diptera/*genetics;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Drosophila melanogaster/genetics;Gene Silencing;Hominidae/*genetics;Humans;Mammals/genetics;Mice/genetics;RNA/*physiology;*Sex Determination Processes;X Chromosome Inactivation;Humanities;Humanism",,

However, despite similar exposures, males and females often have altered disease susceptibility or progression from different stages of life. Fetal growth is largely mediated by the placenta, which, like the fetus is genetically XX or XY. The placenta and its associated trophoblast lineages originate from the trophectoderm (TE) of the early embryo. Rodent models (rat, mouse, spiny mouse), have been used extensively to examine placenta development and these have demonstrated the growth trajectory of the placenta in females is generally slower compared to males, and also shows altered adaptive responses to stressful environments. These placental adaptations are likely to depend on the type of stressor, duration, severity and the window of exposure during development. Here we describe the divergent developmental pathways between the male and female placenta contributing to altered differentiation of the TE derived trophoblast subtypes, placental growth, and formation of the placental architecture. Our focus is primarily genetic or environmental perturbations in rodent models which show altered placental responsiveness between sexes. We suggest that perturbations during early placental development may have greater impact on viability and growth of the female fetus whilst those occurring later in gestation may preferentially affect the male fetus. This may be of great relevance to human pregnancies which result from assisted reproductive technologies or complications such as pre-eclampsia and diabetes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Sequences on the inactive X may cause gene overexpression upon demethylation. X chromosome inactivation has been implicated in female predisposition to autoimmunity. Here we have investigated the epigenetic regulation of X chromosome miRNAs in CD4+ T cells to identify the effect of miRNA on gender bias in autoimmunity. Method: Methylation sensitive mRNA and miRNA from CD4+ T cells were identified by using experimentally demethylated in vitro system using DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azaC). Transcript profiling for isolated RNA was performed by using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Genome-wide qPCR miRNA expression profiling was performed using System Biosciences (SBI) QuantiMir™ RT Kit. Results from hypomethylated experiments were compared to expression profiles from active lupus patients to identify methylation sensitive genes differentially expressed in lupus patients. Most likely oppositely-correlated miRNA: RNA interactions were identified by RNA22 tool from IBM research. Results: When the differential expression between women and men were compared without T cell stimulation, 5-AzaC caused a total of 97 genes to differentially express between women and men of which 78 were female biased genes. However, PMA-ionomycin stimulation caused downregulation of 157 genes out of 170 differentially expressed genes in women. Using a factor of 2 fold as a cut-off, we identified a total of 104 miRNAs up-regulated in 5AzaC treated CD4+ T cells, of which 27 were female biased and 11 were male biased. The X chromosome encoded miRNAs; hsa-let-7f-2∗, hsa-miR-503, hsa-miR-421, hsa-miR-188-3p, hsa-miR-513-a- 3p and hsa-miR-374a were found to be expressed higher in women compared to men in when the DNA was hypomethylated. Furthermore hsa-let-7f-2∗, hsa-miR-503 and hsa-miR-188-3p were highly expressed in active female lupus patients tested (n =4) compared to the healthy controls. Functional Annotation clustering of these miRNA targets revealed that the genes belonging to “response to stress” category being most affected. Conclusion: These results suggest that the miRNA overexpression due to DNA demethylation may contribute to the downregulation of genes observed in hypomethylated CD4+T cells. Furthermore, the demethylation of X chromosome resulting in elevated levels of X chromosome miRNAs, may play a major role in the decreased mRNA levels in stimulated CD4+ T cells in women. This in turn may contribute to the gender differences of gene expression levels.

Developmental differences in this window such as sex-specific variation are implicated in later placental disease states, yet gene expression at this time is poorly understood. METHODS: RNA-sequencing was performed to characterize the transcriptome of 39 first trimester human placentas using chorionic villi following genetic testing (17 females, 22 males). Gene enrichment analysis was performed to find enriched canonical pathways and gene ontologies in the first trimester. DESeq2 was used to find sexually dimorphic gene expression. Patient demographics were analyzed for sex differences in fetal weight at time of chorionic villus sampling and birth. RESULTS: RNA-sequencing analyses detected 14,250 expressed genes, with chromosome 19 contributing the greatest proportion (973/2852, 34.1% of chromosome 19 genes) and Y chromosome contributing the least (16/568, 2.8%). Several placenta-enriched genes as well as histone-coding genes were identified to be unique to the first trimester and common to both sexes. Further, we identified 58 genes with significantly different expression between males and females: 25 X-linked, 15 Y-linked, and 18 autosomal genes. Genes that escape X inactivation were highly represented (59.1%) among X-linked genes upregulated in females. Many genes differentially expressed by sex consisted of X/Y gene pairs, suggesting that dosage compensation plays a role in sex differences. These X/Y pairs had roles in parallel, ancient canonical pathways important for eukaryotic cell growth and survival: chromatin modification, transcription, splicing, and translation. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first characterization of the late first trimester placenta transcriptome, highlighting similarities and differences among the sexes in ongoing human pregnancies resulting in live births. Sexual dimorphism may contribute to pregnancy outcomes, including fetal growth and birth weight, which was seen in our cohort, with males significantly heavier than females at birth.

Conditions that influence the process include gamete interaction, that might give one sex and advantage in the fertilization process and in rates of blastomere cleavage that would allow one sex to accumulate cells at a faster rate. In this scenario, males could accumulate more cells within a defined window of development. Another key difference between males and females is the number of copies of genes located on the sex chromosomes. Transcripts from the Y-chromosome are thought to function as transcription factors, which could accelerate development. Conversely, the X-chromosome contains genes that code for rate limiting steps in pathways key to embryo metabolism and stress reduction. It can be envisioned that prior to X-chromosome inactivation in females, elevated levels of transcripts for such genes may enable greater protection from environmental stress and regulate growth.

The striking female predominance was initially attributed primarily to sex hormones. However, recent data challenge this simplistic view and point more towards genetic and epigenetic factors accounting for this difference. More specifically, several SLE-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to play an important role in the gender predilection in SLE. Their effect is mediated through their involvement in sex-hormone and immune system signalling and dysregulation of the expression of genes and miRNAs pertinent to the immune system. Additionally, the genetic factors are interchangeably associated with epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modification, thus revealing a highly complex network of responsible mechanisms. Of importance, disturbance in the epigenetic process of X chromosome inactivation in females as well as in rare X chromosome abnormalities leads to increased expression of X-linked immune-related genes and miRNAs, which might predispose females to SLE. Microbiota dysbiosis has also been implicated in the sexual dimorphism by the production of oestrogens within the gut and the regulation of oestrogen-responsive immune-related genes.

Although, many studies have demonstrated a role for sex hormone receptor signaling, particularly estrogens, in the direct regulation of innate and adaptive components of the immune system involved in autoimmunity, recent data demonstrate that female sex hormones are not the only cause of the female predisposition. In addition to the action of sex steroid hormones, there is growing evidence for a role of genetic factors linked to the X chromosome. In female mammals, following the mechanisms of X chromosome inactivation (ICX), one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated, resulting in a cellular mosaicism, where about one-half of the cells in a tissue express the maternal X chromosome and the other half the paternal one.

T.",,,,,"Sex chromosome gene dosage compensation is required to ensure equivalent levels of X-linked gene expression between males (46, XY) and females (46, XX). To achieve similar expression, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is initiated in female cells during early stages of embryogenesis. Within each cell, either the maternal or paternal X chromosome is selected for whole chromosome transcriptional silencing, which is initiated and maintained by epigenetic and chromatin conformation mechanisms. With the emergence of small-molecule epigenetic inhibitors for the treatment of disease, such as cancer, the epigenetic mechanism underlying XCI may be inadvertently targeted. Here, we test 2 small-molecule epigenetic inhibitors being used clinically, GSK126 (a histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase inhibitor) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (a histone deacetylase inhibitor), on their effects of the inactive X (Xi) in healthy human female fibroblasts. The combination of these modifiers, at subcancer therapeutic levels, leads to the inability to detect the repressive H3K27me3 modification characteristic of XCI in the majority of the cells. Importantly, genes positioned near the X-inactivation center (Xic), where inactivation is initiated, exhibit robust expression with treatment of the inhibitors, while genes located near the distal ends of the X chromosome intriguingly exhibit significant downregulation. These results demonstrate that small-molecule epigenetic inhibitors can have profound consequences on XCI in human cells, and they underscore the importance of considering gender when developing and clinically testing small-molecule epigenetic inhibitors, in particular those that target the well-characterized mechanisms of X inactivation.","2470-2900 Laskowski, Agnieszka I Fanslow, Danielle A Smith, Erica D Kosak, Steven T DP2 OD008717/OD/NIH HHS/United States F32 GM115046/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States T32 GM008061/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article United States 2018/01/01 Gend Genome. 2018 Jan;2(1):2-7. doi: 10.1177/2470289718787106.

Many diseases present with a clear sex bias, and apart from the influence of sex hormones and socioeconomic and behavioural factors, the X chromosome, X-linked genes and X chromosome inactivation mechanisms contribute to this difference.

Diverse molecular mechanisms have evolved to effectively balance the expressed dose of X-linked genes between XX and XY animals, and to balance expression of X and autosomal genes. Dosage compensation is not understood in birds, in which females (ZW) and males (ZZ) differ in the number of Z chromosomes. RESULTS: Using microarray analysis, we compared the male:female ratio of expression of sets of Z-linked and autosomal genes in two bird species, zebra finch and chicken, and in two mammalian species, mouse and human. Male:female ratios of expression were significantly higher for Z genes than for autosomal genes in several finch and chicken tissues. In contrast, in mouse and human the male:female ratio of expression of X-linked genes is quite similar to that of autosomal genes, indicating effective dosage compensation even in humans, in which a significant percentage of genes escape X-inactivation. CONCLUSION: Birds represent an unprecedented case in which genes on one sex chromosome are expressed on average at constitutively higher levels in one sex compared with the other. Sex-chromosome dosage compensation is surprisingly ineffective in birds, suggesting that some genomes can do without effective sex-specific sex-chromosome dosage compensation mechanisms.","1475-4924 Itoh, Yuichiro Melamed, Esther Yang, Xia Kampf, Kathy Wang, Susanna Yehya, Nadir Van Nas, Atila Replogle, Kirstin Band, Mark R Clayton, David F Schadt, Eric E Lusis, Aldons J Arnold, Arthur P HD07228/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States DK071673/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States T32 HD007228/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States HL28481/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States P01 HL028481/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States DC00217/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States R01 DK071673/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States R01 NS045264/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States R01 DC000217/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States HL30568/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States P01 HL030568/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States NS045264/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States Comparative Study Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2007/03/14 J Biol. 2007;6(1):2. doi: 10.1186/jbiol53.",10.1186/jbiol53,"Animals;Chick Embryo;Chickens/*genetics;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Female;Finches/*genetics;Gene Dosage;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Male;Mice;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Sex Chromosomes;Sex Ratio",,

This hypothesis involves nonsyndromic or “essential” autism with an extremely high male/female ratio in infants who are genetically normal except for common or low penetrance genetic variants. These infants are hypothesized to have a normal physical examination and structurally normal brain imaging, and we characterize this as a non-Mendelian, nondysmorphic (NoMeND) form of autism. These infants are hypothesized to develop deficiency of carnitine and perhaps other nutrients in the brain causing autism that may be amenable to early reversal and prevention through dietary supplementation with carnitine. A mixed, common gene variant-environment hypothesis is proposed with diet, minor illnesses, microbiome, and drugs as possible risk modifiers. We searched for a carnitine-related explanation for the high male/female ratio and found that a gene on the X chromosome in humans and mice (SLC6A14/ Slc6a14) likely escapes random X-inactivation based on the absence of differential methylation on the inactive X chromosome in both species. The SLC6A14 protein is an amino acid and carnitine transporter that functions at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The lack of X-inactivation could lead to greater expression in females than males at the BBB and could limit transport of carnitine across the blood-brain barrier in boys compared to girls. We assessed transport across the BBB in mice by tail vein injection of [14C]-carnitine. At 4 hours, transport to the brain was greater in wild-type female mice compared to male mice, likely due to lack of X-inactivation of Slc6a14. Transport of [14C]-carnitine across the BBB is reduced in female and male Slc6a14 null mutants compared to wild-type mice. These data suggest that Slc6a14-mediated transport across the BBB is greater in female compared to male mice. We propose that differences in carnitine transport across the BBB may contribute to metabolic sexual dimorphism of the brain in mammals, possibly explaining the extremely high male/female ratio in nonsyndromic autism via susceptibility to brain carnitine deficiency. Perhaps the lack of any Recommended Dietary Allowance for carnitine in infants should be reviewed.",L623678029 2018-09-04,10.1177/2326409817722292,carnitine;endogenous compound;animal experiment;animal model;autism;blood brain barrier;carnitine deficiency;conference abstract;controlled study;diet supplementation;dietary reference intake;female;genetic susceptibility;genetic variability;girl;intravenous drug administration;loss of function mutation;male;methylation;microbiome;mouse;nonhuman;nutrient;penetrance;physical examination;protein function;sex difference;tail vein;wild type mouse;X chromosome inactivation;Carnitine;Blood-Brain Barrier;Brain;Autistic Disorder,,

Many explanations have been proposed but have not withstood critical scrutiny. Prior analysis of different cancers with a sex bias has identified six X-linked genes that escape X chromosome inactivation in females and are, therefore, potentially involved in sex differences in survival. Four of the genes are well-known epigenetic regulators that are known to influence the expression of hundreds of other genes and signaling pathways in cancer. Methods: Survival and interaction analysis were performed on the skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), comparing high vs. low expression of KDM6A, ATRX, KDM5C, and DDX3X. The Leeds melanoma cohort (LMC) on 678 patients with primary melanoma was used as a validation cohort. Results: Analysis of TCGA data revealed that two of these genes—KDM6A and ATRX—were associated with improved survival from melanoma. Tumoral KDM6A was expressed at higher levels in females and was associated with inferred lymphoid infiltration into melanoma. Gene set analysis of high KDM6A showed strong associations with immune responses and downregulation of genes associated with Myc and other oncogenic pathways. The LMC analysis confirmed the prognostic significance of KDM6A and its interaction with EZH2 but also revealed the expression of KDM5C and DDX3X to be prognostically significant. The analysis also confirmed a partial correlation of KDM6A with immune tumor infiltrates. Conclusion: When considered together, the results from these two series are consistent with the involvement of X-linked epigenetic regulators in the improved survival of females from melanoma. The identification of gene signatures associated with their expression presents insights into the development of new treatment initiatives but provides a basis for exploration in future studies.",L2004806335 2020-08-05 2020-08-13,10.3390/cancers12082082,transcription factor EZH2;transcriptional regulator ATRX;article;ATRX gene;cancer survival;cohort analysis;comparative study;controlled study;cutaneous melanoma;DDX3X gene;epigenetics;female;gene;gene expression;gene interaction;genetic association;genetic database;human;human cell;immune response;KDM5C gene;KDM6A gene;lymphocytic infiltration;major clinical study;melanoma;overall survival;RNA sequencing;sex difference;signal transduction;Melanoma,,

Modifications of the nucleosomal histones in the genome correlate with the ability or inability of chromatin to form higher order structures, that in turn influence gene activity.

Loss of repression causes sterility in the adults, suggesting that chromatin-based repression is essential for germ line maintenance. The post-embryonic germ line also exhibits unique and dynamic aspects of chromatin regulation, with chromosome-wide regulation particularly evident on the X chromosome. Several properties of X-specific chromatin assembly are also sex-specific. These properties appear to be responding to the meiotic pairing status of the X chromosome, rather than the sex of the germ cells.

Although, many studies have demonstrated a role for sex hormone receptor signaling, particularly estrogens, in the direct regulation of innate and adaptive components of the immune system, recent data suggest that female sex hormones are not the only cause of the female predisposition to autoimmunity. Besides sex steroid hormones, growing evidence points towards the role of X-linked genetic factors. In female mammals, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated during embryonic development, resulting in a cellular mosaicism, where about one-half of the cells in a given tissue express either the maternal X chromosome or the paternal one. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is however not complete and 15 to 23% of genes from the inactive X chromosome (Xi) escape XCI, thereby contributing to the emergence of a female-specific heterogeneous population of cells with bi-allelic expression of some X-linked genes.

During carcinogenesis, co-localized clones of cells carrying genetic and epigenetic lesions may interact to overcome normal cellular homeostasis, setting the stage for tumor progression. This interpretation and available data support the use of some cancer driver mutations (CDMs) as reporters of carcinogenesis. Cells carrying a subset of CDMs, often referred to as hotspot CDMs, are remarkably prevalent in normal tissues, as well as in tumors, where they are detected frequently as subpopulations. Studies with model carcinogens established that geometric mean CDM mutant fractions (MFs) can serve as biomarkers of carcinogenic potential following acute or sub-chronic exposures. For some studies, the CDMs measured in tissues of treated rodents (as log10 MF geomean or log10 MF standard deviation) can be correlated with tumor responses produced by chronic exposures to the same carcinogens. Variation in cancer driver MF across rodents within a treatment group (log10 MF standard deviation), for a panel of CDMs, may more accurately capture the stochastic nature of cancer driver mutational impact on tumor initiation, clonal expansion and tumor response than a measure of treatment group central tendency. CDMs have important advantages as biomarkers of cancer risk that warrant broader, systematic investigation; they are sensitive in vivo endpoints and carcinogenic effects detected using evolutionarily conserved rodent CDMs are likely relevant to human. Progress in this area has been limited by the inability to analyze more than one CDM at a time, but error-corrected next-generation sequencing (EC-NGS) approaches now provide an opportunity to examine multiple hotpot CDMs at once. Thus, EC-NGS should be utilized to test the hypothesis that within-treatment group variation for a battery of CDMs can be used as a metric to predict future cancer risk and provide a biologically-based foundation for rodent to human extrapolation.",L2001347581 2018-12-06 2018-12-11,10.1016/j.cotox.2018.11.003,"4 biphenylamine;aristolochic acid;azoxymethane;B Raf kinase;biological marker;ethylene oxide;fluorenylacetohydroxamic acid;K ras protein;phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate 3 kinase;protein p53;bioassay;body surface;cancer risk;cancer susceptibility;carcinogen testing;carcinogenesis;gene mutation;genetic risk;genetic toxicology;human;high throughput sequencing;nonhuman;phenotype;point mutation;population dynamics;prevalence;priority journal;review;risk assessment;sex difference;tumor growth;X chromosome inactivation;Risk Assessment",,

Many investigations have concentrated on the effects of female and male sex hormones on immune function, by suggesting that estrogens favor the antibody production-enhancing Th2 response and, by doing so, possibly, increase the risk towards abnormal autoimmune function. Others have suggested that women are genetically predisposed towards abnormal autoimmune function, possibly because the X chromosome may confer susceptibility towards tolerance breakdown. Recent developments have, however, opened new research avenues. The possible association between persistent fetal-maternal microchimerism and the development of autoimmune diseases has attracted special interest. Since, in analogy to allogeneic organ transplantation, fetal-maternal (and maternal-fetal) microchimerism may play an important role in the immunologic tolerance of the fetal semi-allograft, female preponderance for autoimmune diseases may be understood as a consequence of increased allogeneic cell traffic in females (in comparison to males), increased risk for long-term microchimerism and, therefore, as a consequence of the former two, the development of abnormal autoimmunity. Under an evolutionary view point the occurrence of antoimmune diseases, in general, can be seen as the price to be paid for successful reproduction. In view of increased exposure to cell traffic, women, of course, would be expected to pay a higher price, reflected in more autoimmunity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

X. and Zhao, H. Y.",,,,,"The polygenic risk score (PRS) is calculated as the weighted sum of an individual's genotypes and their estimated effect sizes, which is often used to estimate an individual's genetic susceptibility to complex traits and disorders. It is well known that some complex human traits or disorders have sex differences in trait distributions, disease onset, progression, and treatment response, although the underlying mechanisms causing these sex differences remain largely unknown. PRSs for these traits are often based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data with both male and female samples included, ignoring sex differences. In this study, we present a benchmark study using both simulations with various combinations of genetic correlation and sample size ratios between sexes and real data to investigate whether combining sex-specific PRSs can outperform sex-agnostic PRSs on traits showing sex differences. We consider two types of PRS models in our study: single-population PRS models (PRScs, LDpred2) and multiple-population PRS models (PRScsx). For each trait or disorder, the candidate PRSs were calculated based on sex-specific GWAS data and sex-agnostic GWAS data. The simulation results show that applying LDpred2 or PRScsx to sex-specific GWAS data and then combining sex-specific PRSs leads to the highest prediction accuracy when the genetic correlation between sexes is low and the sample sizes for both sexes are balanced and large. Otherwise, the PRS generated by applying LDpred2 or PRScs to sex-agnostic GWAS data is more appropriate. If the sample sizes between sexes are not too small and very unbalanced, combining LDpred2-based sex-specific PRSs to predict on the sex with a larger sample size and combining PRScsx-based sex-specific PRSs to predict on the sex with a smaller size are the preferred strategies. For real data, we considered 19 traits from Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium studies and UK Biobank with both sex-specific GWAS data and sex-agnostic GWAS data. We found that for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) related traits, accounting for sex differences and incorporating information from the opposite sex could help improve PRS prediction accuracy. Taken together, our findings in this study provide guidance on how to calculate the best PRS for sex-differentiated traits or disorders, especially as the sample size of GWASs grows in the future.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 0 Total Times Cited: 0 Cited Reference Count: 27,10.3389/fgene.2022.892950,polygenic risk score;genome-wide association study;sex-specific;risk prediction;human genetics;X-INACTIVATION,,

It is known that maternal recognition of pregnancy and successful implantation are driven by mutual interactions between the elongated conceptus and the maternal endometrium. While most of the genes involved in regulation of embryo development are located on autosomal chromosomes, gene expression on sex chromosomes is modulating development through sex-specific transcription. To gain more insights into the dynamic transcriptome of preimplantation embryos at the onset of elongation and into X-linked gene expression, RNA-seq analyses were performed for single female and male porcine embryos collected on Days 8, 10, and 12 of pregnancy. Results A high number of genes were differentially expressed across the developmental stages (2174 and 3275 for Days 8 vs 10, and 10 vs 12, respectively). The majority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in embryo elongation, development, and embryo-maternal interaction. Interestingly, a number of DEGs was found with respect to embryo sex (137, 37, and 56 on Days 8, 10 and 12, respectively). At Day 8, most of these DEGs were X-linked (96). Strikingly, the number of DEGs encoded on the X chromosome dramatically decreased from Day 10 to Day 12.

XIST-dependent genes lack promoter DNA methylation and require continual XIST-dependent histone deacetylation. XIST RNA-directed proteomics and CRISPRi screen reveal distinctive somatic cell-specific XIST complexes, and identify TRIM28 that mediates Pol II pausing at promoters of X-linked genes in B cells. XIST dysregylation, reflected by escape of XIST-dependent genes, occurs in CD11c+ atypical memory B cells across single-cell transcriptome data in patients with female-biased autoimmunity and COVID-19 infection.

There is a growing body of evidence that suggests biological sex affects the host response to these nanomaterials. Given that male and female tissues do have distinct profiles of secreted factors, it is reasonable to expect that these adsorb to the surface of nanomaterials. These differences in the composition of the adsorbed biomolecular corona may induce different cellular responses based upon their biological sex. A sexual bias has been observed in the tissue-specific accumulation of nanomaterials, the extent of inflammation, and epigenetic modification induced by nanomaterials. While most of these studies involved exposure to environmental nanomaterials, there were limited examples that evaluated sexual biases related to nanomaterials for drug delivery, especially to the brain. A patient's sex may influence the therapeutic or general host response to nanomaterials commonly used for biomedical applications. Herein, we begin with a description of the biomolecular corona as the effective interface between nanomaterials and biological systems. Then, the molecular aspects of sexual differentiation are presented regarding genetic factors, hormonal regulation, and mechanisms of processing xenobiotics, as the foundation from which to explore the sex-specific effects of nanomaterials.

Q. and Zhang, Y. and Wang, P. and Liu, W. and Wu, X. B. and Zhou, J. Y.",,,,,"Background: X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is an important gene regulation mechanism in females to equalize the expression levels of X chromosome between two sexes. Generally, one of two X chromosomes in females is randomly chosen to be inactivated. Nonrandom XCI (XCI skewing) is also observed in females, which has been reported to play an important role in many X-linked diseases. However, there is no statistical measure available for the degree of the XCI skewing based on family data in population genetics. Results: In this article, we propose a statistical approach to measure the degree of the XCI skewing based on family trios, which is represented by a ratio of two genotypic relative risks in females. The point estimate of the ratio is obtained from the maximum likelihood estimates of two genotypic relative risks. When parental genotypes are missing in some family trios, the expectation-conditional-maximization algorithm is adopted to obtain the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates. Further, the confidence interval of the ratio is derived based on the likelihood ratio test. Simulation results show that the likelihood-based confidence interval has an accurate coverage probability under the situations considered. Also, we apply our proposed method to the rheumatoid arthritis data from USA for its practical use, and find out that a locus, rs2238907, may undergo the XCI skewing against the at-risk allele. But this needs to be further confirmed by molecular genetics. Conclusions: The proposed statistical measure for the skewness of XCI is applicable to complete family trio data or family trio data with some paternal genotypes missing. The likelihood-based confidence interval has an accurate coverage probability under the situations considered. Therefore, our proposed statistical measure is generally recommended in practice for discovering the potential loci which undergo the XCI skewing.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 4 Total Times Cited: 4 Cited Reference Count: 41,10.1186/s12863-018-0694-8,X chromosome inactivation;Skewing;Family trio;Ratio estimate;ASSOCIATION TEST;GENE-EXPRESSION;SEX-DIFFERENCES;LINKED GENE;VARIABLES;CARRIERS;BRAIN;ASSAY;X Chromosome,,

These phenotypes are consistent with the expression patterns we have identified in mouse brain where Jarid1c mRNA was detected in hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. Jarid1c expression and associated active histone marks at its 5′ end are high in P19 neutrons, indicating that JARID1C demethylase plays an important role in differentiated neuronal cells. We found that XX mice expressed Jarid1c more highly than XY mice, independent of their gonadal types (testes versus ovaries). This increased expression in XX mice is consistent with Jarid1c escape from X inactivation and is not compensated by expression from the Y-linked paralogue Jarid1c, which is expressed at a very low level compared to the X paralogue in P19 cells.

We show that Xist RNA and heterochromatin modifications transiently reappear at the Xi and are missing in mature single positive T cells. Activation of mature T cells restores Xist RNA and heterochromatin marks simultaneously back to the Xi.

Here we used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high throughput sequencing to investigate whether K27-me3, which characterizes a stable, inactive chromatin structure and repression of transcription, is associated with the silencing of male-specific genes in female liver, or of female-specific genes in male liver. We used SICER, an algorithm designed to identify broad enriched domains ('islands') from genomic sequencing data (1), to identify chromosomal regions enriched in K27-me3 marks. We found K27-me3 enriched on the X-chromosome in female compared to male liver, consistent with its role in X-chromosome inactivation (2). On autosomes, K27-me3 was enriched in male mouse liver across the gene body and in flanking regions of a subset of female-specific genes, including Cyp2a4, Cyp2c39, A1bg, Fmo3, Hao3 and Sult3a1, where results were validated by qPCR. The female-specific genes preferentially marked with K27-me3 in male liver showed a significantly higher sex difference in expression than those that were not so marked, and the sex-difference in K27-me3 sequence read density was inversely correlated with the magnitude of the sex-difference in gene expression (r = -0.5, p <10-3). Male-specific genes preferentially marked with K27-me3 islands in female liver were also identified, but showed a lower sex-difference in sequence reads, and no correlation with the magnitude of sex-difference in gene expression was observed. These findings support the proposal that K27-me3 plays a specific role in the silencing of female-specific genes in male liver. The pituitary/GH-dependence of the female-specific genes thus marked indicates that K27-me3 is a constitutive repressive mark that requires the female GH profile to relieve repression in female liver.",L70676307 2012-03-05,,"growth hormone;histone H3;lysine;liver;gene;female;male;society;mouse;sex difference;gene expression;algorithm;X chromosome;chromatin immunoprecipitation;autosome;X chromosome inactivation;density;DNA flanking region;chromatin structure;high throughput sequencing;Lysine;Genes, Regulator;Histones;Liver",,

No biological explanation, including hormonal differences, has been identified so far. We hypothesize that this gender difference in incidence and survival involves X-linked tumor suppressor genes and/or oncogenes whose expression is affected by X-chromosome alterations. Methods: DNA and RNA were extracted from 49 fresh frozen primary melanomas (32 females, 17 males, distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) <3 years or follow up >3 years) and subjected to array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Supervised and unsupervised cluster analyses were performed. X-inactivation was studied by Xist RNA in situ hybridization and androgen receptor methylation-sensitive PCR. The expression of a candidate X-linked gene was analyzed by quantitative PCR and correlated with DMFS in uni- and multivariate analyses. Results: Supervised cluster analyses revealed distinct DNA signatures associated with clinical and histopathological characteristics. Unsupervised clustering identified three groups of which one was composed of predominantly female patients (10/13) and associated with the worst DMFS. This group was characterized by loss of one X-chromosome in 7 of the 13 patients. Loss of X correlated with poor DMFS of female patients (logrank p=0.009). Intriguingly, the lost X chromosome was systematically the inactivated copy. Among the 17 males, Y-chromosome loss correlated with DMFS (logrank p=0.015). We found that the PPP2R3B gene, located within one of the pseudoautosomal regions and thus not inactivated on the inactive X in females, is lost from the Y in males. PPP2R3B encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 that may negatively control cell proliferation via targets such as CDC6 or RB. Quantitative analysis of PPP2R3B mRNA expression in an independent sample set of melanomas revealed a strong correlation between decreased levels of PPP2R3B expression and poor DMFS irrespective of gender in multivariate analysis (p=0.0007).",L70691302 2012-03-23,10.1158/1538-7445.Am2011-4835,RNA;DNA;phosphoprotein phosphatase 2;messenger RNA;androgen receptor;melanoma;cancer research;distant metastasis free survival;sex chromosome;male;female;human;X chromosome;patient;cluster analysis;survival;gene;multivariate analysis;chromosome loss;cell proliferation;quantitative analysis;gender;sex difference;tumor suppressor gene;oncogene;follow up;comparative genomic hybridization;X chromosome inactivation;in situ hybridization;methylation;Y chromosome;Sex Chromosomes;Melanoma;Neoplasm Metastasis,,

SLE prevalence is also elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of CD27+ plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold increase over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class switch during the TLR7-driven, T cell–dependent differentiation of naive B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. TLR7 escape from X inactivation endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands.

The genetic basis for this sex-bias arises from the X chromosome. Female mammals, with two X chromosomes, utilize the epigenetic process of X Chromosome Inactivation (XCI), which transcriptionally silences one X. Expression of the long noncoding RNA Xist from the inactive X (Xi) reorganizes the Xi into a compact, bipartite structure, and targets the Xi to the nuclear periphery in somatic cells. The paradigm of XCI maintenance in somatic cells is stable association of Xist RNA and heterochromatic marks on the Xi, which function to maintain the Xi structure. Recently, we found a dynamic mechanism of XCI maintenance in female lymphocytes. In naïve female B cells, Xist RNA is not localized to the Xi, but after stimulation Xist RNA and heterochromatin marks return to the Xi. How this dynamic XCI process impacts Xi structure in lymphocytes is unknown, including which factors regulate Xi nuclear organization in this system. Using a novel allele-specific imaging system, we will present new findings on the compaction and organization of the Xi in lymphocytes. Additionally, we are investigating the regulatory roles of chromatin organization and nuclear structure proteins for lymphocyte-specific XCI maintenance, and how these factors regulate X-linked gene expression.

Both syndromes are associated with several clinical phenotypes, whose molecular mechanisms are obscure, and show a range of inter-individual penetrance. In order to understand the effect of abnormal numbers of X chromosome on the methylome and its correlation to the variable clinical phenotype, we performed a genome-wide methylation analysis using MeDIP and Illumina’s Infinium assay on individuals with four karyotypes: 45,X, 46,XY, 46,XX, and 47,XXY. Results: DNA methylation changes were widespread on all autosomal chromosomes in 45,X and in 47,XXY individuals, with Turner individuals presenting five times more affected loci. Differentially methylated CpGs, in most cases, have intermediate methylation levels and tend to occur outside CpG islands, especially in individuals with Turner syndrome. The X inactivation process appears to be less effective in Klinefelter syndrome as methylation on the X was decreased compared to normal female samples. In a large number of individuals, we verified several loci by pyrosequencing and observed only weak inter-loci correlations between the verified regions. This suggests a certain stochastic/random contribution to the methylation changes at each locus. Interestingly, methylation patterns on some PAR2 loci differ between male and Turner syndrome individuals and between female and Klinefelter syndrome individuals, which possibly contributed to this distinguished and unique autosomal methylation patterns in Turner and Klinefelter syndrome individuals.

MiRNAs play an important role in central nervous system development; therefore, dysregulation of miRNAs is connected to changes in behaviour and cognition observed in many disorders including ASD. Based on previously published work, on diagnosing ASD using miRNAs, we hypothesized that miRNAs can be used as biomarkers in children with suspected developmental disorders (DD) including ASD within Bosnian-Herzegovinian (B&H) population. 14 selected miRNAs were tested on saliva of children with suspected developmental disorders including ASD. The method of choice was qRT-PCR as a relatively cheap method available in most diagnostic laboratories in low to mid-income countries (LMIC). Out of 14 analysed miRNAs, 6 were differentially expressed between typically developing children and children with some type of developmental disorder including autism spectrum disorder. Using the most optimal logistic regression, we were able to distinguish between ASD and typically developing (TD) children. We have found 5 miRNAs as potential biomarkers. From those, 3 were differentially expressed within the ASD cohort. All 5 miRNAs had shown good chi-square statistics within the logistic regression performed on all 14 analysed miRNAs. The accuracy of 5-miRNAs model training set was 90.2%, while the validation set had a 90% accuracy.

Males have only one copy of the X chromosome, while diploid females are subject to X chromosome inactivation. In addition, the X chromosome codes for many immune-related genes, supporting the hypothesis that X-linked genes could contribute to TB susceptibility in a sex-biased manner. We report the first TB susceptibility genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a specific focus on sex-stratified autosomal analysis and the X chromosome. A total of 810 individuals (410 cases and 405 controls) from an admixed South African population were genotyped using the Illumina Multi Ethnic Genotyping Array, specifically designed as a suitable platform for diverse and admixed populations. Association testing was done on the autosome (8,27,386 variants) and X chromosome (20,939 variants) in a sex stratified and combined manner. SNP association testing was not statistically significant using a stringent cut-off for significance but revealed likely candidate genes that warrant further investigation.

X dosage compensation has been well characterized in the soma, but not in the germ line. Germ cells face a special challenge, because genome wide reprogramming erases epigenetic marks responsible for maintaining the X dosage compensated state.

With the current emphasis on developing personalized approaches to cancer treatment, it is astonishing that we have not yet systematically incorporated the biology of sex differences into our paradigms for laboratory and clinical cancer research. While some sex differences in cancer arise through the actions of circulating sex hormones, other sex differences are independent of estrogen, testosterone, or progesterone levels. Instead, these differences are the result of sexual differentiation, a process that involves genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, in addition to acute sex hormone actions. Sexual differentiation begins with fertilization and continues beyond menopause. It affects virtually every body system, resulting in marked sex differences in such areas as growth, lifespan, metabolism, and immunity, all of which can impact on cancer progression, treatment response, and survival. These organismal level differences have correlates at the cellular level, and thus, males and females can fundamentally differ in their protections and vulnerabilities to cancer, from cellular transformation through all stages of progression, spread, and response to treatment.

However, the relevant regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. To investigate whether sex-biased gene expression in mammalian brain is globally regulated or locally regulated in diverse brain structures, and to study the genomic organisation of brain-expressed sex-biased genes, we performed a large scale gene expression analysis of distinct brain regions in adult male and female mice.Results: This study revealed spatial specificity in sex-biased transcription in the mouse brain, and identified 173 sex-biased genes in the striatum; 19 in the neocortex; 12 in the hippocampus and 31 in the eye. Genes located on sex chromosomes were consistently over-represented in all brain regions. Analysis on a subset of genes with sex-bias in more than one tissue revealed Y-encoded male-biased transcripts and X-encoded female-biased transcripts known to escape X-inactivation. In addition, we identified novel coding and non-coding X-linked genes with female-biased expression in multiple tissues. Interestingly, the chromosomal positions of all of the female-biased non-coding genes are in close proximity to protein-coding genes that escape X-inactivation. This defines X-chromosome domains each of which contains a coding and a non-coding female-biased gene. Lack of repressive chromatin marks in non-coding transcribed loci supports the possibility that they escape X-inactivation. Moreover, RNA-DNA combined FISH experiments confirmed the biallelic expression of one such novel domain.Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the amount of genes with sex-biased expression varies between individual brain regions in mouse. The sex-biased genes identified are localized on many chromosomes. At the same time, sexually dimorphic gene expression that is common to several parts of the brain is mostly restricted to the sex chromosomes. Moreover, the study uncovered multiple female-biased non-coding genes that are non-randomly co-localized on the X-chromosome with protein-coding genes that escape X-inactivation. This raises the possibility that expression of long non-coding RNAs may play a role in modulating gene expression in domains that escape X-inactivation in mouse. © 2010 Reinius et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",L51138667 2010-11-09 2010-12-07,10.1186/1471-2164-11-614,DNA;RNA;untranslated RNA;animal tissue;article;brain;chromosome positioning;controlled study;corpus striatum;eye;female;fluorescence in situ hybridization;gender bias;gene control;gene expression;gene location;gene overexpression;hippocampus;male;mouse;neocortex;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;RNA transcription;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;Mice;Bias (Epidemiology),,

We performed a large-scale sex-bias expression analysis of genes on the X-chromosome in six different somatic tissues from mouse.Results: Our results show that the mouse X-chromosome is enriched with female-biased genes and depleted of male-biased genes. This suggests that feminisation as well as de-masculinisation of the X-chromosome has occurred in terms of gene expression in non-reproductive tissues. Several mechanisms may be responsible for the control of female-biased expression on chromosome X, and escape from X-inactivation is a main candidate. We confirmed escape in case of Tmem29 using RNA-FISH analysis. In addition, we identified novel female-biased non-coding transcripts located in the same female-biased cluster as the well-known coding X-inactivation escapee Kdm5c, likely transcribed from the transition-region between active and silenced domains. We also found that previously known escapees only partially explained the overrepresentation of female-biased X-genes, particularly for tissue-specific female-biased genes. Therefore, the gene set we have identified contains tissue-specific escapees and/or genes controlled by other sexually skewed regulatory mechanisms. Analysis of gene age showed that evolutionarily old X-genes (>100 myr, preceding the radiation of placental mammals) are more frequently female-biased than younger genes.Conclusion: Altogether, our results have implications for understanding both gene regulation and gene evolution of mammalian X-chromosomes, and suggest that the final result in terms of the X-gene composition (masculinisation versus feminisation) is a compromise between different evolutionary forces acting on reproductive and somatic tissues. © 2012 Reinius et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",L52300793 2012-11-15 2013-01-17,10.1186/1471-2164-13-607,article;controlled study;female;feminization;fluorescence in situ hybridization;gene;gene cluster;gene expression;gene expression regulation;genetic transcription;Kdm5c gene;male;masculinity;molecular evolution;mouse;nonhuman;placental mammal;radiation;RNA analysis;sex difference;Tmem29 gene;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Gene Expression;X Chromosome;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Previous studies have found that young females are protected against ischemia compared to males, partially due to the protective effect of ovarian hormones, particularly estrogen (E2). However, there are also genetic and epigenetic effects of X chromosome dosage that contribute to stroke sensitivity and neuroinflammation after injury, especially in the aged. Genes that escape from X chromosome inactivation (XCI) contribute to sex-specific phenotypes in many disorders. Kdm5c and kdm6a are X escapee genes that demethylate H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, respectively. We hypothesized that the two demethylases play critical roles in mediating the stroke sensitivity. Methods: To identify the X escapee genes involved in stroke, we performed RNA-seq in flow-sorted microglia from aged male and female wild type (WT) mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The expression of these genes (kdm5c/kdm6a) were confirmed in four core genotypes (FCG) mice and in post-mortem human stroke brains by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot, and RT-PCR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were conducted to detect DNA levels of inflammatory interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 4/5 precipitated by histone H3K4 and H3K27 antibodies. Manipulation of kdm5c/kdm6a expression with siRNA or lentivirus was performed in microglial culture, to determine downstream pathways and examine the regulatory roles in inflammatory cytokine production. Results: Kdm5c and kdm6a mRNA levels were significantly higher in aged WT female vs. male microglia, and the sex difference also existed in ischemic brains from FCG mice and human stroke patients. The ChIP assay showed the IRF 4/5 had higher binding levels to demethylated H3K4 or H3K27, respectively, in female vs. male ischemic microglia. Knockdown or over expression of kdm5c/kdm6a with siRNA or lentivirus altered the methylation of H3K4 or H3K27 at the IRF4/5 genes, which in turn, impacted the production of inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: The KDM-Histone-IRF pathways are suggested to mediate sex differences in cerebral ischemia.

To normalize X-linked gene expression between sexes, one X in female cells is randomly selected for transcriptional silencing through X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), resulting in allele-specific enrichment of epigenetic modifications, including histone methylation and the long noncoding RNA XIST/Xist on the inactive X (Xi). As we have previously shown that epigenetic regulation of the Xi in female lymphocytes from mice is unexpectedly dynamic, we used RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence to profile epigenetic features of the Xi at the single-cell level in human B cell subsets from pediatric and adult SLE patients and healthy controls. Our data reveal that abnormal XCI maintenance in B cells is a feature of SLE. Using single-cell and bulk-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we found that X-linked immunity genes escape XCI in specific healthy human B cell subsets and that human SLE B cells exhibit aberrant expression of X-linked genes and XIST RNA interactome genes. Our data reveal that mislocalized XIST RNA, coupled with a dramatic reduction in heterochromatic modifications at the Xi in SLE, predispose for aberrant X-linked gene expression from the Xi, thus defining a genetic and epigenetic pathway that affects X-linked gene expression in human SLE B cells and likely contributes to the female bias in SLE.",L2012940958 2021-06-15 2021-12-08,10.1073/pnas.2024624118,adult;article;autoimmunity;B lymphocyte;B lymphocyte activation;bulk cell RNA sequencing;child;controlled study;epigenetics;female;fibroblast;fluorescence in situ hybridization;gene expression;genetic transcription;heterochromatin;human;human cell;immunofluorescence;in vitro study;memory cell;RNA sequencing;single cell RNA seq;single nucleotide polymorphism;systemic lupus erythematosus;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

A higher percentage of premature male than female infants require invasive respiratory support and preterm males have a higher incidence of lung disease e.g. bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).The TLR4 pathway is an essential component of innate immunity and results in NFκB activation. Many TLR4 signalling genes are encoded on the X chromosome, including IKBKG/NEMO, IRAK-1, and BTK. Genes which escape X chromosome inactivation (XCI) may contribute to the immune advantage observed in female neonates. The aim of this study was to quantify expression of X-linked TLR4 signalling intermediates in umbilical cord blood from term female versus male neonates. Cord blood samples were collected from neonates (≥37w+0) delivered by elective Caesarean section (M:F, 10:10, n=20).

IRAK-1 protein expression was quantifed by Western blot and subcellular localisation was characterised in PBMCs by confocal microscopy. At the mRNA level, there was no significant difference in relative expression of IKBKG/NEMO or BTK. IRAK-1 gene and protein expression was significantly higher in females versus males (p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001). Confocal microscopy confirmed significantly increased cytosolic IRAK-1 expression in females. XCI occurs early in embryogenesis however some genes can escape inactivation.

Birds have previously shown to have only limited dosage compensation, leading to high sex bias of Z-chromosome gene expression. In chickens, a male hyper-methylated region (MHM) on the Z-chromosome has been associated with a local type of dosage compensation, but a more detailed characterization of the avian methylome is limiting our interpretations. Here we report an analysis of genome wide sex differences in promoter DNA-methylation and gene expression in the brain of three weeks old chickens, and associated sex differences in behavior of Red Junglefowl (ancestor of domestic chickens). Combining DNA-methylation tiling arrays with gene expression microarrays we show that a specific locus of the MHM region, together with the promoter for the zinc finger RNA binding protein (ZFR) gene on chromosome 1, is strongly associated with sex dimorphism in gene expression. Except for this, we found few differences in promoter DNA-methylation, even though hundreds of genes were robustly differentially expressed across distantly related breeds. Several of the differentially expressed genes are known to affect behavior, and as suggested from their functional annotation, we found that female Red Junglefowl are more explorative and fearful in a range of tests performed throughout their lives.

Briefly, by using an inverse-variance method we determined the effect size difference of gene expression between males and females. We found the greatest sex differences in gene expression in the brain, specifically in the anterior cingulate cortex, (1818 genes), followed by the heart (375 genes), kidney (224 genes), colon (218 genes), and thyroid (163 genes). More interestingly, we found different parts of the brain with varying numbers and identity of sex-biased genes, indicating that specific cortical regions may influence sexually dimorphic traits. The majority of sex-biased genes in other tissues such as the bladder, liver, lungs, and pancreas were on the sex chromosomes or involved in sex hormone production. On average in each tissue, 32% of autosomal genes that were expressed in a sex-biased fashion contained androgen or estrogen hormone response elements. Interestingly, across all tissues, we found approximately two-thirds of autosomal genes that were sex-biased were not under direct influence of sex hormones.

The genetic basis for this bias is the Xchromosome, where the greatest concentration of immunity related genes on any chromosome can be found. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and through a process, known as X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), silence one of their X-chromosomes randomly to have a similar level of X-linked gene expression as males (XY). In XCI, XIST RNA, a long non-coding RNA, is expressed from the future inactive X (Xi) and is bound to it in cis by the transcription factor YY1. As XIST coats the Xi, it recruits heterochromatin modifiers to condense and silence it. Previous research has shown that human SLE patient B cells exhibit altered localization of XIST RNA, thus indicating that they have partial reactivation of the Xi. To explore this relationship, we worked with NZB/W F1mice, which are a well-characterized murine model of SLE that also displays a female bias. The hypothesis of our study is that due to reduced expression of YY1, NZB/W F1 mice have altered Xist RNA localization leading to increased expression of X-linked genes in splenic B cells. Preliminary results using qPCR indicate that the concentration of YY1 is reduced across all stages of disease in NZB/W F1 when compared to age-matched wild type (WT) mice. Using Xist RNA FISH, we have observed that the activated B cells of late stage disease NZB/W F1 mice have decreased localization of Xist RNA to the Xi when compared to WT.

Currently, predictions of genes that participate in sponge-based regulation are largely based on sequence homology alone, which may not adequately reflect the cellular environment in which lncRNA: miRNA pairs interact. The vast number of potential interactions generated by these predictions impedes the identification of functional gene regulatory relationships, which necessitates an approach that considers biological context. XIST, the female-specific lncRNA canonically involved in silencing the X chromosome, has been suggested by many studies to act as a miRNA sponge. The sex-specificity of XIST provides the opportunity to study the biological feasibility of proposed XIST-miRNA interactions. Here we take a comprehensive approach by considering factors that affect possible regulation through XIST-miRNA sponging. Results To identify the most feasible candidates in a particular tissue (lung adenocarcinomas), we considered protein-coding genes that (1) were positively correlated with XIST expression within sexes, (2) were targeted by miRNAs shared with XIST, and (3) expressed in lung adenocarcinoma. This revealed a robust set of 124 genes potentially positively regulated by XIST through the sequestration of 804 shared miRNAs. We then used the basic sex-specific nature of XIST to compare the changes in miRNA-target gene relationships in endogenously high-XIST and low-XIST systems to discover a high-confidence set of only 13 miRNA-gene pairs. As XIST is expressed exclusively in the nucleus, we validated the nuclear presence of several of these high-confidence miRNAs using RT-qPCR, confirming the co-localization required for XIST to interact with these species. Conclusions We use a biology-driven approach to identify genes defended from miRNA-based inhibition by the lncRNA XIST. Importantly, we identify that only a small subset of miRNAs predicted by sequence homology alone have the capacity to mediate the XIST-target gene axis, as they are enriched in the nucleus and able to co-localize with XIST for sponging. Our results reinforce the necessary consideration of biological features in future studies of lncRNA: miRNA interactions.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 8 Total Times Cited: 8 Cited Reference Count: 22,10.1371/journal.pone.0221371,x-chromosome inactivation;gene;rnas;expression;micrornas,,

C.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L72320517&from=export,,,,"We have previously shown sex and genetic background differences in citrulline production and in De novo arginine synthesis in mice. These differences were the consequence of a higher expression of intestinal ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the synthesis of citrulline, in mice of Swiss background when compared with BL6 animals. The OTC gene is in the X chromosome and thus females have the potential to overexpress this gene due to incomplete X inactivation. Also many gene polymorphisms have been described among different genetic backgrounds, which may also result in a differential expression and citrulline production in mice. Likewise, genetic polymorphisms may result in a differential utilization of arginine among mouse strains. To test the effect of sex and genetic background on the arginine metabolome and fluxome C57BL6/J (B) and SJL/J (S) mice were mated to produce a F1 BB, BS, SB and SS offspring. At 6-8 weeks of age and after a 3 h fast, male and female mice were infused for 4 h with tracers to determine citrulline, ornithine and arginine fluxes, as well as the De novo arginine synthesis rate and arginine disposal by arginase. A phenylalanine tracer was also infused to determine protein breakdown and arginine contribution from this source to the overall arginine flux. The flux of citrulline was higher (P < 0.01) in females and in mice with a SJL progenitor. This resulted in a greater (P < 0.01) De novo arginine synthesis in females and in mice with a SJL mother. No difference (P > 0.15) between sexes or genotypes was observed for the fraction of citrulline utilized for plasma arginine synthesis (75±2%). Arginine and phenylalanine fluxes were higher (P<0.03) in mice with both SJL parents. Furthermore, arginine flux was higher (P<0.02) in males than in females. This was accompanied by a higher ornithine flux and a higher rate of conversion of plasma arginine into ornithine in females, indicating a higher arginase activity. The ratio of arginine from protein turnover to phenylalanine flux was lower in females (1.16 vs 1.50, P<0.001) demonstrating that some of the arginine disposal takes place immediately after protein breakdown. Plasma arginine and citrulline concentrations were not different (P > 0.08) among the different genotypes or the two sexes. Likewise there were no sex differences for ornithine concentration; however, plasma ornithine was higher (P < 0.03) in mice with at least one SJL progenitor. These results show that females produce more citrulline than males, which results in a greater rate of De novo arginine synthesis. Males, however, are able to support higher arginine fluxes than females due to a reduction in the hydrolysis of arginine into ornithine (arginase activity). Furthermore, some of this disposal of arginine takes place even before this amino acid enters the circulation. The measurement of arginine and related amino acids fluxes and interconversions were able to capture these complex interactions between sex and genetic background; the arginine metabolome analysis, however, failed to do so.",L72320517 2016-06-29,,citrulline;arginine;ornithine;phenylalanine;arginase;amino acid;tracer;ornithine carbamoyltransferase;mitochondrial enzyme;mouse;female;synthesis;plasma;male;metabolome;genotype;protein degradation;gene;Swiss;mouse strain;human;genetic polymorphism;protein metabolism;parent;DNA polymorphism;mother;X chromosome inactivation;X chromosome;progeny;sex difference;hydrolysis;Swiss James Lambert mouse;Mice;Arginine,,

However, the mechanisms underlying the sex dichotomy are complicated and remain elusive. We have reported that the sex chromosome complement contributes to the stroke sensitivity in aged animals. Kdm6a and Kdm5c, two genes escaping from X chromosome inactivation (XCI), are demethylases of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 respectively. The two genes have higher expression in XX vs. XY cardiac tissue and are implicated in mediating expression of inflammatory mediators. We hypothesize that Kdm6a and Kdm5c are also differently expressed in brains of mice with two vs. one copy of X chromosome, and lead to sex differences in post-stroke inflammation and stroke outcomes in aged mice. Methods: Aged (18-22 months) WT C57BL/6 and FCG mice (XXF, XYF, XXM, and XYM) were subjected to a 60-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Stroke outcomes including infarct size and behavior deficits were evaluated at 3d of MCAO. Initial screening of X-escapee genes was performed by RNAseq. Microglial activation and peripheral immune cell infiltration were determined by flow cytometry (FC). Expression of Kdm6a and kdm5c was evaluated by RT-PCR and IHC. Epigenetic markers (H3K27me1/3 and H3K4me1/3) downstream to Kdm6a and kdm5c were examined by Western blot. Results: RNAseq data revealed a significantly higher mRNA levels of Kdm6a and Kdm5c in WT female vs. male microglia. WT female brains had dramatic increase of both kdm6a and kdm5c expression after MCAO compared to male brains, corresponding to higher levels of H3K27me1 and H3K4me1 in females. Brain mRNA levels of Kdm6a and Kdm5c were also significantly increased in XXF/XXM compared to XYF/XYM FCG mice. Importantly, microglia from XXF/XXM mice express more Kdm6a and kdm5c than XYF/XYM microglia, accompanied by higher expression of H3K27me1 and H3K4me1 in XXF and XXM mice brains. XXF/XXM microglia had higher levels of intracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL1β, iNOS, IL6) after stroke. Conclusion: Mice with two X chromosomes have robust expression of kdm6a and kdm5c in microglia that leads to high epigenetic modification of inflammatory gene expression.

This includes changes on a genome-wide scale and additionally in females the remodeling of the inactive X-chromosome to enable X-chromosome reactivation (XCR). However, if global remodeling and X-chromosomal remodeling are related, how they occur in PGCs in vivo in relation to their migration progress and which factors are important are unknown. Results: Here we identify the germ cell determinant PR-domain containing protein 14 (PRDM14) as the first known factor that is instrumental for both global reprogramming and X-chromosomal reprogramming in migrating mouse PGCs. We find that global upregulation of the repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) mark is PRDM14 dosage dependent in PGCs of both sexes. When focusing on XCR, we observed that PRDM14 is required for removal of H3K27me3 from the inactive X-chromosome, which, in contrast to global upregulation, takes place progressively along the PGC migration path. Furthermore, we show that global and X-chromosomal reprogramming of H3K27me3 are functionally separable, despite their common regulation by PRDM14.

To date, the expression profile of lncRNA in human term placenta has not been fully established. This study was conducted to characterize the lncRNA expression profile in human term placenta and to verify whether there are differences in the transcriptomic profile between the sex of the fetus and pregnancy multiplicity. RNA-Seq data were used to profile, quantify, and classify lncRNAs in human term placenta. The applied methodology enabled detection of the expression of 4463 isoforms from 2899 annotated lncRNA loci, plus 990 putative lncRNA transcripts from 607 intergenic regions. Those placentally expressed lncRNAs displayed features such as shorter transcript length, longer exon length, fewer exons, and lower expression levels compared to messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Among all placental transcripts, 175,268 were classified as mRNAs and 15,819 as lncRNAs, and 56,727 variants were discovered within unannotated regions. Five differentially expressed lncRNAs (HAND2-AS1, XIST, RP1-97J1.2, AC010084.1, TTTY15) were identified by a sex-bias comparison. Splicing events were detected within 37 genes and 4 lncRNA loci.

However, few X-linked associations have been reported in genome-wide association studies, partly due to analytical complications and low statistical power. Results: In this study, we propose tests of X-linked association that capitalize on variance heterogeneity caused by various factors, predominantly the process of X-inactivation. In the presence of X-inactivation, the expression of one copy of the chromosome is randomly silenced. Due to the consequent elevated randomness of expressed variants, females that are heterozygotes for a quantitative trait locus might exhibit higher phenotypic variance for that trait. We propose three tests that build on this phenomenon: 1) A test for inflated variance in heterozygous females; 2) A weighted association test; and 3) A combined test. Test 1 captures the novel signal proposed herein by directly testing for higher phenotypic variance of heterozygous than homozygous females. As a test of variance it is generally less powerful than standard tests of association that consider means, which is supported by extensive simulations. Test 2 is similar to a standard association test in considering the phenotypic mean, but differs by accounting for (rather than testing) the variance heterogeneity. As expected in light of X-inactivation, this test is slightly more powerful than a standard association test. Finally, test 3 further improves power by combining the results of the first two tests. We applied the these tests to the ARIC cohort data and identified a novel X-linked association near gene AFF2 with blood pressure, which was not significant based on standard association testing of mean blood pressure. Conclusions: Variance-based tests examine overdispersion, thereby providing a complementary type of signal to a standard association test.

To explore this, we generated 76 genome-wide RNA-seq profiles from mouse eight-cell embryos, late gestation and adult livers, together with 4 ground-state pluripotent embryonic (ES) cell lines from which we generated both RNA-seq and multiple ChIP-seq profiles. We complemented this with previously published data to yield 5 snap-shots of pre-implantation development, late-gestation placenta and somatic tissue and multiple adult tissues for integrative analysis. Results: We define a high-confidence sex-dimorphic signature of 69 genes in eight-cell embryos. Sex-chromosome-linked components of this signature are largely conserved throughout pre-implantation development and in ES cells, whilst the autosomal component is more dynamic. Sex-biased gene expression is reflected by enrichment for activating and repressive histone modifications. The eight-cell signature is largely non-overlapping with that defined from fetal liver, neither was it correlated with adult liver or other tissues analysed. The number of sex-dimorphic genes increases throughout development. We identified many more dimorphic genes in adult compared to fetal liver. However, approximately two thirds of the dimorphic genes identified in fetal liver were also dimorphic in adult liver. Sex-biased expression differences unique to adult liver were enriched for growth hormone-responsiveness. Sexually dimorphic gene expression in pre-implantation development is driven by sex-chromosome based transcription, whilst later development is characterised by sex dimorphic autosomal transcription.

C. and Konig, B.",,,,,"Background Appropriate social interactions influence animal fitness by impacting several processes, such as mating, territory defense, and offspring care. Many studies shedding light on the neurobiological underpinnings of social behavior have focused on nonapeptides (vasopressin, oxytocin, and homologues) and on sexual or parent-offspring interactions. Furthermore, animals have been studied under artificial laboratory conditions, where the consequences of behavioral responses may not be as critical as when expressed under natural environments, therefore obscuring certain physiological responses. We used automated recording of social interactions of wild house mice outside of the breeding season to detect individuals at both tails of a distribution of egocentric network sizes (characterized by number of different partners encountered per day). We then used RNA-seq to perform an unbiased assessment of neural differences in gene expression in the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus and the hypothalamus between these mice with naturally occurring extreme differences in social network size. Results We found that the neurogenomic pathways associated with having extreme social network sizes differed between the sexes. In females, hundreds of genes were differentially expressed between animals with small and large social network sizes, whereas in males very few were. In males, X-chromosome inactivation pathways in the prefrontal cortex were the ones that better differentiated animals with small from those with large social network sizes animals. In females, animals with small network size showed up-regulation of dopaminergic production and transport pathways in the hypothalamus. Additionally, in females, extracellular matrix deposition on hippocampal neurons was higher in individuals with small relative to large social network size.

In mice and humans, epilepsy occurs only in heterozygous females who have a mixture of PCDH19 wild-type (WT) and mutant cells caused by random X-inactivation; it does not occur in hemizygous PCDH19 mutant males. This unique inheritance pattern strongly suggests the underlying disease mechanism operates via interference between WT and mutant cells rather than being a result of complete loss of PCDH19 functions. Although it remains unclear whether the other symptoms of EFMR also conform to this unique genotype-phenotype relationship, PCDH19 mutant males were recently reported to demonstrate autism-like symptoms. We, therefore, used a Pcdh19 knockout (KO) mouse model to ask whether a complete lack of PCDH19 causes autism-like behaviors. Consistent with the autism observed in EFMR females, we found Pcdh19 heterozygous KO female mice (with mosaic expression of PCDH19) show defects in sociability in the 3-chamber test. Surprisingly, hemizygous Pcdh19 KO male mice (without any PCDH19 expression) exhibit impaired sociability in the 3-chamber test and reduced social interactions in the reciprocal social interaction test. We also observed that, compared to WT mice, mutant mice display more repetitive behaviors, including self-grooming and rearing. These findings indicate that hemizygous Pcdh19 KO male mice show autism-like phenotypes.",L629926433 2019-12-02 2019-12-05,10.1186/s13041-019-0519-3,animal experiment;animal model;article;autism;brain disease;compulsion;controlled study;epilepsy in females with mental retardation;female;gene;gene deletion;genotype phenotype correlation;hemizygosity;heterozygosity;knockout mouse;male;mosaicism;mouse;nonhuman;priority journal;protocadherin 19 gene;rearing;self grooming;sex difference;social interaction;Mice;Autistic Disorder,,

Recently we examined the role of sex chromosomes in sex differences in myocardial I/R injury. We discovered that gonadectomized mice with two X chromosomes (XX or XXY) have ∼50% larger infarct size after I/R injury, compared to mice with one X chromosome (XY or XO). Only few X genes escape X inactivation and are expressed higher in XX than XY individuals. Here we examined the role of “X escapee” histone demethylase Kdm6a which is important in cardiac development. Methods: Female mice with a heterozygous global knockout of Kdm6a (Kdm6a+/-) and with 2 copies of Kdm6a (Kdm6a+/+, regular WT) were used. Isolated mouse hearts were subjected to 30 min global normothermic ischemia followed by 60 min reperfusion. RNA-Seq analysis was performed by comparing gene expression in hearts of Kdm6a+/+ vs. Kdm6a+/- females at baseline before ischemia. We calculated an unbiased composite score of relevance in which the level of significance of the Kdm6a effect on expression (p value) was integrated with the size of the KDM6A effect on expression (fold change), and with the amount of H3K27me3 mark found on the genes in the heart based on online ChIP-Seq data. Two way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Values are expressed as mean± SE. Results: Kdm6a+/+ female mice had significantly lower heart functional recovery compared to their littermate Kdm6a+/- (LVDP: 46.7±9.8% vs. 79.8±3.5%; RPP: 44.1±10.5% vs. 76.2±8.5%, n=6-8 mice/group, p<0.01). The integration of our RNA-Seq data using the hearts of female mice with 2 vs. 1 copy of Kdm6a (n=4 samples per group) with online datasets measuring the H3K27me3 mark, sex differences in expression in humans and mice, and involvement in ischemic heart failure, revealed carbonic anhydrase-3 (Car3) as the most interesting candidate (upregulated ∼7 fold in the hearts of Kdm6a+/+ vs. Kdm6a+/- female mice) at baseline. Car3 encodes one isoform of carbonic anhydrase, involved in pH regulation, which is a critical part of I/R injury.

It is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 with much semblance to SARS-CoV including the sequence homology and disease symptoms. It is reported to be more infectious than SARS-CoV due to higher binding affinities between its spike protein and the ACE2 receptor on cell surface. Despite this, its case fatality rate is much lower compared with that of SARS-CoV although it varies in different countries. However, the case fatality rate increases steadily with age and it is reported to be the highest in aged COVID-19 male patients in almost all countries. Consistent with these, females have higher antiviral immune responses. Males and females are different in inflammatory response and aberrantly hyperactive cytokines are the main lethal causes of COVID-19. Interestingly, the gene encoding the ACE2 receptor protein and some genes encoding the immune regulatory proteins such as TLR7 are located on X chromosome which is subject to X chromosome inactivation and sex hormone regulation. These may account for some sex-dependent immune responses and lethality observed in COVID-19 patients. In general, children are less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and only less than 1% of pediatric COVID-19 patients may die of COVID-19. However, the most severe pediatric cases become multisystem inflammatory syndrome that is similar to Kawasiki disease with features of viral infection.

M. A. and Meganathan, K. and Baldridge, D. and Gontarz, P. and Zhang, B. and Bonni, A. and Constantino, J. N. and Kroll, K. L.",,,,,"Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with pronounced heritability in the general population. This is largely attributable to the effects of polygenic susceptibility, with inherited liability exhibiting distinct sex differences in phenotypic expression. Attempts to model ASD in human cellular systems have principally involved rare de novo mutations associated with ASD phenocopies. However, by definition, these models are not representative of polygenic liability, which accounts for the vast share of population-attributable risk. Methods: Here, we performed what is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to model multiplex autism using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in a family manifesting incremental degrees of phenotypic expression of inherited liability (absent, intermediate, severe). The family members share an inherited variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in GPD2, a gene that was previously associated with developmental disability but here is insufficient by itself to cause ASD. iPSCs from three first-degree relatives and an unrelated control were differentiated into both cortical excitatory (cExN) and cortical inhibitory (cIN) neurons, and cellular phenotyping and transcriptomic analysis were conducted. Results: cExN neurospheres from the two affected individuals were reduced in size, compared to those derived from unaffected related and unrelated individuals. This reduction was, at least in part, due to increased apoptosis of cells from affected individuals upon initiation of cExN neural induction. Likewise, cIN neural progenitor cells from affected individuals exhibited increased apoptosis, compared to both unaffected individuals. Transcriptomic analysis of both cExN and cIN neural progenitor cells revealed distinct molecular signatures associated with affectation, including the misregulation of suites of genes associated with neural development, neuronal function, and behavior, as well as altered expression of ASD risk-associated genes. Conclusions: We have provided evidence of morphological, physiological, and transcriptomic signatures of polygenic liability to ASD from an analysis of cellular models derived from a multiplex autism family. ASD is commonly inherited on the basis of additive genetic liability. Therefore, identifying convergent cellular and molecular phenotypes resulting from polygenic and monogenic susceptibility may provide a critical bridge for determining which of the disparate effects of rare highly deleterious mutations might also apply to common autistic syndromes.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 9 Total Times Cited: 10 Cited Reference Count: 107,10.1186/s13229-019-0306-0,Multiplex autism;iPSC modeling;Neurodevelopment;Cortical excitatory neurons;Cortical inhibitory neurons;Transcriptomics;Gene networks;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;SPECTRUM DISORDERS;INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY;GENE;RECURRENCE;MODEL;EXPRESSION;BEHAVIOR;RISK;PROTOCADHERINS;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

Consequently, there is a lack of detailed studies on this kind of mosaicism in all groups of patients. Previous reports have identified a deficit of males among asymptomatic carriers of N/unbalanced Rea. Three mechanisms were proposed for explaining this phenomenon, including a high instability in the early female embryonic development, a male-specific selection against abnormal cells in the early embryo development, or a high intrauterine lethality of male carriers. To address these possibilities, we have performed a meta-analysis of male-to-female ratio (sex ratio, SR) in prenatally diagnosed and in spontaneously aborted carriers of mosaic Rea. Results: One hundred and twenty one prenatally detected cases of normal cell line/autosome rearrangement mosaicism (N/Rea) with known carriers' sex were identified from the literature. Carriers of N/unbalanced Rea presented with 38 abnormal and 28 normal/apparently normal outcomes while carriers of N/balanced Rea presented with 24 normal and 3 abnormal outcomes. 58% of carriers of N/unbalanced Rea with an abnormal outcome displayed a high proportion (> 50%) of amniocytes with the abnormality compared to 25% of carriers with normal/apparently normal outcome. More female carriers of N/unbalanced Rea were identified with an abnormal outcome (15 M/23F) in contrast to a notable male predominance (18 M/10F) among those with normal outcome.

However, sex differences studies of inflammatory and immune responses during puberty prevail in literature. Investigation of immune responses to LPS peculiarities in prepubertal females and males may contribute to the development of more effective immunotherapy and minimize side effects of children vaccination. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the LPS-induced SIRS sex differences in prepubertal Wistar rats. Despite the absence of sex differences in estradiol and testosterone levels, LPS-induced inflammatory changes in liver and lungs are more pronounced among males. Males demonstrate the increasing neopterin, corticosterone levels and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity. Not less important is that in females, demonstrating less morphological changes in liver and lungs, endotoxin level is tenfold higher, and corticosterone level decreases. Thus, endotoxin cannot be used as a marker of the severity of multiple organ failure in prepubertal period. The LPS-induced immune reactions in females and males are similar and are characterized by immunosuppression. Both females and males have decreased production of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta) and the absolute number of CD3 + and CD3 + CD8 + lymphocytes in blood. The acute atrophy of thymus and apoptosis of thymic cells are revealed in animals of both sexes. However, the number of CD3 + CD4 + T-helpers and CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T-cells decreases only in females with SIRS, and in males there was a decrease of CD45R + B-cells.

It is caused by pathogenic variants of the gene EDA and defined by a triad of hypotrichosis, hypo- or anodontia, and hypo- or anhidrosis which may lead to life-threatening hyperthermia. Although female carriers are less severely affected than male patients, they display symptoms, too, with high phenotypic variability. This study aimed to elucidate whether phenotypic differences in female XLHED patients with identical EDA genotypes might be explained by deviating X-chromosome inactivation (XI) patterns. Methods: Six families, each consisting of two sisters with the same EDA variant and their parents (with either mother or father being carrier of the variant), participated in this study. XLHED-related data like sweating ability, dental status, facial dysmorphism, and skin issues were assessed. We determined the women`s individual XI patterns in peripheral blood leukocytes by the human androgen receptor assay and collated the results with phenotypic features. Results: The surprisingly large inter- and intrafamilial variability of symptoms in affected females was not explicable by the pathogenic variants. Our cohort showed no higher rate of nonrandom XI in peripheral blood leukocytes than the general female population. Furthermore, skewed XI patterns in favour of the mutated alleles were not associated with more severe phenotypes.

Based on these observations we propose a hypothesis that those who harbor elevated frequencies of MN within their cells are more prone to RNA virus infection and are more likely, through combined effects of leakage of self-DNA from MN and RNA from viruses, to escalate pro-inflammatory cytokine production via the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) mechanisms to an extent that is unresolvable and therefore confers high risk of causing tissue damage by an excessive and overtly toxic immune response. The corollaries from this hypothesis are (i) those with abnormally high MN frequency are more prone to infection by RNA viruses; (ii) the extent of cytokine production and pro-inflammatory response to infection by RNA viruses is enhanced and possibly exceeds threshold levels that may be unresolvable in those with elevated MN levels in affected organs; (iii) reduction of MN frequency by improving nutrition and life-style factors increases resistance to RNA virus infection and moderates inflammatory cytokine production to a level that is immunologically efficacious and survivable.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 4 Total Times Cited: 4 Cited Reference Count: 225,10.1016/j.mrrev.2021.108395,Micronuclei;Aneuploidy;Viruses;COVID-19;cGAS-STING;Inflammation;PERIPHERAL-BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES;DNA-DAMAGE-RESPONSE;OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;SECRETORY PHENOTYPE;SEX-DIFFERENCES;CELLULAR SENESCENCE;GENOMIC INSTABILITY;MOSAIC LOSS;RIG-I;Cytokines,,

This remains constant in the progeny of these cells throughout life. The XIST gene is a principal regulator of X-chromosome inactivation expressed in inactive female X-chromosomes. It encodes a long noncoding RNA which leads to recruitment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)-methylase, and eventual inactivation of transcripts of most X-chromosome genes on inactive X-chromosomes. The clonality of human tumors is central to our understanding of malignant and premalignant diseases such as polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). Clonal populations can be detected by expression of X-chromosome genes in females. In a normal female embryo, there are eight cells at the time of random embryonic X-chromosome inactivation; thus X-chromosome allelic ratios vary from female to female. This ratio is stable in time, identical in all blood cell lineages, and the same for any interrogated X-linked gene in females heterozygous for other X-chromosome inactivated genes (Prchal, J Exp Med, 1 996). Based on polymorphisms for 5 X-chromosome genes (MPP1, FHL1, IDS, BTK, and G6PD), we developed a quantitative transcriptional clonality assay and found that allelic usage ratios are the same for each marker and in each myeloid cell line (Swierczek, Blood 2009). In two PV (P1, P3) and one ET (P2) females, we observed expression of both alleles of either the IDS or G6PD genes in platelets and granulocytes, whereas other X-chromosome genes for which these women were heterozygous were expressed only a single allele. We then analyzed their X-chromosome transcripts in clonogenic assays of early erythroid progenitors (BFU-E). Each of these females had some BFU-E which expressed both X-chromosome genes. Reactivation of inactivated X-chromosomes was reported in some human breast cancers (Richardson, Cancer Cell, 2006) and was associated with overexpression of a small subset of X-chromosomal oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes (Thakur, Mole Cancer Res, 2007). Further, conditional Xist deletion inhematopoietic stem cells of female mice resulted in global X-chromosome reactivation and complete penetrance of a highly aggressive PV/ET-like syndrome that progressed to fatal lymphoma, acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (Yildirim, Cell, 2013). Our previous, unbiased, whole exome sequencing of 31 JAK2V617F positive PV patients identified 87 somatic and germline mutations, with most patients having two or more somatic mutations (Wang, Leukemia, 2014). The majority of mutated genes were epigenetic modifiers; i.e. ASXL1, DNMT3A, TET2, SF3B1 and PDE4C. We interrogated the effects of epigenetic modifiers on methylation of DNA of CD34 cells and granulocytes by whole genome methylome analysis and demonstrated inconsistent, scattered hypomethylation changes in autosomes of both males and females. However, there were large regions of the hypomethylated X-chromosome genome in many but not all PV and ET females. We examined transcript levels of the hypomethylated genes by QT-RTPCR and found augmentation of transcripts of many but not all hypomethylated genes in granulocytes and platelets in these PV females. However, XIST transcripts were not decreased. The ChIP analysis of clonal granulocytes revealed decreased level of H3K27me3 at hypomethylated regions of biallelically expressed G6PD and IDS genes. We then performed unbiased transcriptome analysis by RNA seq of 24 PV and ET males and females (Figure). We observed more overexpressed genes (75%) on X chromosome than autosomes (66%).The X-cromosome encoded miR-221 (reported dysregulated in ET; Navarro, Blood Cancer Journal, 2016) and ARHGAP6 were overexpressed in PV and ET but more in females than males (Figure). The miR-221 targets SOCS1 and SOCS3 genes, negative regulators of the JAK2/STAT pathway, and the ARHGAP6 gene is a component of PDGF signaling pathway. It remains to be determined which pomethylated X-chromosome genomic regions have functional activity in hematopoiesis in some PV females but miR-221 and ARHGAP6 are potential candidates. These data may contribute to a better understanding of gender differences of the PV phenotype and PV morbidity and mortality.

Evidence has also been reported for sex-related differences in the pathophysiology of MDD, with female patients showing a greater severity of symptoms, higher degree of functional impairment, and more atypical depressive symptoms. Males and females also differ in their responsiveness to antidepressants. These clinical findings suggest that sex-dependent molecular and neural mechanisms may underlie the development of depression and the actions of antidepressant medications.

Differences in sex chromosome copy numbers between sexes and X-chromosome inactivation in females result in distinctive sex-specific patterns in the distribution of DNA methylation levels. In this study, we present a software tool, sEst, which incorporates clustering analysis to infer sex and to detect sex-chromosome abnormalities from DNA methylation microarray data.

Although genes on the X chromosome have been implicated in clefting, there has been no association analysis of X-linked markers. Methodology/Principal Findings: We added new functionalities in the HAPLIN statistical software to enable association analysis of X-linked markers and an exploration of various causal scenarios relevant to orofacial clefts. Genotypes for 48 SNPs in 18 candidate genes on the X chromosome were analyzed in two population-based samples from Scandinavia (562 Norwegian and 235 Danish case-parent triads). For haplotype analysis, we used a sliding-window approach and assessed isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (iCL/P) separately from isolated cleft palate only (iCPO). We tested three statistical models in HAPLIN, allowing for: i) the same relative risk in males and females, ii) sex-specific relative risks, and iii) X-inactivation in females. We found weak but consistent associations with the oral-facial-digital syndrome 1 (OFD1) gene (formerly known as CXORF5) in the Danish iCL/P samples across all models, but not in the Norwegian iCL/P samples. In sex-specific analyses, the association with OFD1 was in male cases only. No analyses showed associations with iCPO in either the Norwegian or the Danish sample. Conclusions: The association of OFD1 with iCL/P is plausible given the biological relevance of this gene. However, the lack of replication in the Norwegian samples highlights the need to verify these preliminary findings in other large datasets.

It is well established that gene silencing on the Xi is maintained through repressive epigenetic processes, including histone deacetylation and DNA methylation. Recent studies revealed a new mechanism where RNA-binding proteins that interact directly with the RNA contribute to the maintenance of Xist localization and gene silencing. In addition, a surprising plasticity of the Xi was uncovered with many genes becoming upregulated upon experimental deletion of Xist. Intriguingly, immune cells normally lose Xist from the Xi, suggesting that thisXist dependence is utilized in vivo to dynamically regulate gene expression from the Xi.

However, a porcine XIST has not yet been thoroughly identified despite its biological importance in a wide variety of research fields. Here, we present a full-length porcine XIST sequence assembled using known sequences (GenBank), RNA-Seq data (NCBI SRA), and PCR/sequencing. The proposed porcine XIST gene model encodes a 25,215-bp transcript consisting of 7 exons, including two conserved and two porcine-specific repeat regions. Transcription covering the entire XIST region was observed specifically in female cells, but not in male cells. We also identified eight transcription starting sites (TSSs) and evaluated CpG methylation patterns in the upstream (+2.0 kb) and downstream (-2.0 kb) regions. Sixty-seven CG di-nucleotides identified in the target region were considered to be candidate CpG sites, and were enriched in the following two regions: -284 to +53 bp (13 sites) and +285 to +1,727 bp (54 sites) from the selected TSS. Male 5' region of XIST (64.5 sites, 96.26%) had a higher level of CpG methylation than female DNA (33.4 sites, 49.85%). Taken together, our results revealed that the porcine XIST gene is expressed exclusively in female cells, which is influenced by the lower level of CpG methylation in the putative promoter region compared with male cells.

It is packaged into heterochromatin on the active X chromosome but into euchromatin and bound by the epigenetic organizer protein CTCF on the inactive X chromosome. Because its DNA sequence diverges rapidly beyond the New World monkeys, the existence of DXZ4 outside the primate lineage is unknown. Results: Here we extend our comparative genome analysis and report the identification and characterization of the mouse homolog of the macrosatellite. Furthermore, we provide evidence of DXZ4 in a conserved location downstream of the PLS3 gene in a diverse group of mammals, and reveal that DNA sequence conservation is restricted to the CTCF binding motif, supporting a central role for this protein at this locus. However, many features that characterize primate DXZ4 differ in mouse, including the overall size of the array, the mode of transcription, the chromatin organization and conservation between adjacent repeat units of DNA sequence and length. Ctcf binds Dxz4 but is not exclusive to the inactive X chromosome, as evidenced by association in some males and equal binding to both X chromosomes in trophoblast stem cells.

Generally speaking, adult females show stronger innate and adaptive immune responses than males. This results in lower risk of developing most of the infectious diseases and a better ability to clear viral infection in women (1–5). On the other hand, women are at increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases (AID) such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, and the autoimmune liver diseases autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) (6). Factors contributing to the female sex bias in autoimmune diseases include environmental exposure, e.g., microbiome, behavior, and genetics including X chromosomal inactivation of genes. Several lines of evidence and clinical observations clearly indicate that sex hormones contribute significantly to disease pathogenesis, and the role of estrogen in autoimmune diseases has been extensively studied. In many of these diseases, including the autoimmune liver diseases, T cells are thought to play an important pathogenetic role. We will use this mini-review to focus on the effects of androgens on T cells and how the two major androgens, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune liver diseases (AILD).",L632565121 2020-08-20 2021-04-12,10.3389/fimmu.2020.01567,androgen;androgen receptor;androstanolone;CD40 antigen;CD8 antigen;CD86 antigen;cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4;estrogen;granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor;histone deacetylase 3;immunoglobulin M;interleukin 10;interleukin 13;interleukin 2;interleukin 23;interleukin 6;major histocompatibility antigen class 2;protein p53;sex hormone binding globulin;T lymphocyte receptor;testosterone;toll like receptor 7;ursodeoxycholic acid;zinc transporter;animal cell;antigen presenting cell;autoimmune disease;autoimmune hepatitis;autoimmune liver disease;C2C12 cell line;cell differentiation;cell proliferation;female;gene expression;genetic transcription;hormone substitution;human;human cell;hypergammaglobulinemia;immune response;immunological tolerance;menstrual cycle;mouse;multiple sclerosis;nonhuman;orchitis;pilot study;primary biliary cirrhosis;prostate epithelium cell;prostate hypertrophy;protein phosphorylation;regulatory T lymphocyte;review;systemic lupus erythematosus;T lymphocyte;testosterone metabolism;Th17 cell;thymus tissue;upregulation;X chromosome inactivation;Liver Diseases,,

There is substantial individual variability in the aging process between men and women. In general, women live longer than men, consistent with lower biological ages as assessed by molecular biomarkers, but there is a paradox. Women are frailer and have worse health at the end of life, while men still perform better in physical function examinations. Moreover, many age-related diseases show sex-specific patterns. In this review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on sexual dimorphism in human studies, with support from animal research, on biological aging and illnesses.

The process of X chromosome inactivation regulated by lncRNA Xist is important for dose compensation of immune-related X-linked genes between the sexes. This study aimed to explore a Xist-related pathway which might lead to the female preponderance of NMOSD. Some studies have shown that lncRNA Xist may interact with transactive response DNA-binding protein (TARDBP, also known as TDP43). TDP43 can be cleaved by caspase-3 into its active form, TDP35, which might increase the level of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), while IRF3 may promote the proliferation of Th17 cells. Our preliminary study conducted in peripheral blood mononuclear cell of female NMOSD patients showed the same trend with above literatures. Based on those studies and our preliminary results, we hypothesized that in the CD4+ na??ve T cells of female NMOSD patients, the downregulation of lncRNA Xist decreased its interaction with TDP43 and released more TDP43 to be cleaved to its active form TDP35, thereby inhibits IRF3 degradation, and then promotes the differentiation and proliferation of Th17 cells and induced the inflammation of female NMOSD patients.

Results: Here, we comprehensively characterize 5hmC in the prefrontal cortices of 24 subjects. We show that, although there is inter-individual variability in 5hmC content among unrelated individuals, approximately 8 % of all CpGs on autosomal chromosomes contain 5hmC, while sex chromosomes contain far less. Our data also provide evidence suggesting that 5hmC has transcriptional regulatory properties, as the density of 5hmC was highest in enhancer regions and within exons. Furthermore, we link increased 5hmC density to histone modification binding sites, to the gene bodies of actively transcribed genes, and to exon-intron boundaries.

Identification of epigenetic alterations occurring in these disorders could shed light on molecular pathways relevant to neurodevelopment. Results: Using a genome-wide approach, we identified genes with significant loss of DNA methylation in blood of males with intellectual disability and mutations in the X-linked KDM5C gene, encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase, in comparison to age/sex matched controls. Loss of DNA methylation in such individuals is consistent with known interactions between DNA methylation and H3 lysine 4 methylation. Further, loss of DNA methylation at the promoters of the three top candidate genes FBXL5, SCMH1, CACYBP was not observed in more than 900 population controls. We also found that DNA methylation at these three genes in blood correlated with dosage of KDM5C and its Y-linked homologue KDM5D. In addition, parallel sex-specific DNA methylation profiles in brain samples from control males and females were observed at FBXL5 and CACYBP. Conclusions: We have, for the first time, identified epigenetic alterations in patient samples carrying a mutation in a gene involved in the regulation of histone modifications. These data support the concept that DNA methylation and H3 lysine 4 methylation are functionally interdependent.

D.",,,,,"Background: Development of the placenta during the late first trimester is critical to ensure normal growth and development of the fetus. Developmental differences in this window such as sex-specific variation are implicated in later placental disease states, yet gene expression at this time is poorly understood. Methods: RNA-sequencing was performed to characterize the transcriptome of 39 first trimester human placentas using chorionic villi following genetic testing (17 females, 22 males). Gene enrichment analysis was performed to find enriched canonical pathways and gene ontologies in the first trimester. DESeq2 was used to find sexually dimorphic gene expression. Patient demographics were analyzed for sex differences in fetal weight at time of chorionic villus sampling and birth. Results: RNA-sequencing analyses detected 14,250 expressed genes, with chromosome 19 contributing the greatest proportion (973/2852, 34.1% of chromosome 19 genes) and Y chromosome contributing the least (16/568, 2.8%). Several placenta-enriched genes as well as histone-coding genes were identified to be unique to the first trimester and common to both sexes. Further, we identified 58 genes with significantly different expression between males and females: 25 X-linked, 15 Y-linked, and 18 autosomal genes. Genes that escape X inactivation were highly represented (59.1%) among X-linked genes upregulated in females. Many genes differentially expressed by sex consisted of X/Y gene pairs, suggesting that dosage compensation plays a role in sex differences. These X/Y pairs had roles in parallel, ancient canonical pathways important for eukaryotic cell growth and survival: chromatin modification, transcription, splicing, and translation. Conclusions: This study is the first characterization of the late first trimester placenta transcriptome, highlighting similarities and differences among the sexes in ongoing human pregnancies resulting in live births. Sexual dimorphism may contribute to pregnancy outcomes, including fetal growth and birth weight, which was seen in our cohort, with males significantly heavier than females at birth.

Nonetheless, while men have a decreased risk of developing MS, many studies suggest that males have a worse clinical outcome. MS exhibits an apparent sexual dimorphism in both the immune response and the pathophysiology of the CNS damage, ultimately affecting disease susceptibility and progression differently. Overall, women are predisposed to higher rates of inflammatory relapses than men, but men are more likely to manifest signs of disease progression and worse CNS damage.

While susceptibility genes located in the sex chromosomes have been identified in ASD, it is unclear whether they are sufficient to explain the male bias or whether gonadal hormones also play a key role. We evaluated the sex chromosomal and hormonal influences on the male bias in a murine model of ASD, in which mice are exposed in utero to a maternal antibody reactive to contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2), which was originally cloned from a mother of a child with ASD (termed C6 mice henceforth). In this model, only male mice are affected. We used the four-core-genotypes (FCG) model in which the Sry gene is deleted from the Y chromosome (Y-) and inserted into autosome 3 (TgSry). Thus, by combining the C6 and FCG models, we were able to differentiate the contributions of sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones to the development of fetal brain and adult behavioral phenotypes. We show that the presence of the Y chromosome, or lack of two X chromosomes, irrespective of gonadal sex, increased the susceptibility to C6-induced phenotypes including the abnormal growth of the developing fetal cerebral cortex, as well as a behavioral pattern of decreased open-field exploration in adult mice. Our results indicate that sex chromosomes are the main determinant of the male bias in the maternal C6-induced model of ASD.

Epidemiologic studies have shifted from an exclusive focus on the identification of genetic risk alleles for such disorders to recognizing and understanding the contribution of xenobiotic exposures, infections, and the maternal immune system during the prenatal and early post-natal periods. In this review we discuss the growing literature regarding the effects of maternal brain-reactive antibodies on fetal brain development and their contribution to the development of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Autoimmune diseases primarily affect women and are more prevalent in mothers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, mothers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are significantly more likely to have an autoimmune disease than women of neurotypically developing children. Moreover, they are four to five times more likely to harbor brain-reactive antibodies than unselected women of childbearing age. Many of these women exhibit no apparent clinical consequence of harboring these antibodies, presumably because the antibodies never access brain tissue. Nevertheless, these maternal brain-reactive antibodies can access the fetal brain, and some may be capable of altering brain development when present during pregnancy. Several animal models have provided evidence that in utero exposure to maternal brain-reactive antibodies can permanently alter brain anatomy and cause persistent behavioral or cognitive phenotypes. Although this evidence supports a contribution of maternal brain-reactive antibodies to neurodevelopmental disorders, an interplay between antibodies, genetics, and other environmental factors is likely to determine the specific neurodevelopmental phenotypes and their severity. Additional modulating factors likely also include the microbiome, sex chromosomes, and gonadal hormones. These interactions may help to explain the sex-bias observed in neurodevelopmental disorders.

Certain biological phenomena, such as X chromosome inactivation and parental imprinting, affect ASE most drastically by completely shutting down the expression of a whole set of alleles. Other more subtle effects on ASE are likely to be much more complex and dependent on the genetic environment and are perhaps more important to understand since they may be responsible for a significant amount of biological diversity. Tools to assess ASE in a diploid biological system are becoming more reliable. Non-diploid systems are, however, not uncommon. In humans full or partial polyploid states are regularly found in both healthy (meiotic cells, polynucleated cell types) and diseased tissues (trisomies, non-disjunction events, cancerous tissues). In this work we have studied ASE in the medaka fish model system. We have developed a method for determining ASE in polyploid organisms from RNAseq data and we have implemented this method in a software tool set. As a biological model system we have used nuclear transplantation to experimentally produce artificial triploid medaka composed of three different haplomes. We measured ASE in RNA isolated from the livers of two adult, triploid medaka fish that showed a high degree of similarity. The majority of genes examined (82%) shared expression more or less evenly among the three alleles in both triploids. The rest of the genes (18%) displayed a wide range of ASE levels. Interestingly the majority of genes (78%) displayed generally consistent ASE levels in both triploid individuals. A large contingent of these genes had the same allele entirely suppressed in both triploids. When viewed in a chromosomal context, it is revealed that these genes are from large sections of 4 chromosomes and may be indicative of some broad scale suppression of gene expression. © 2014 Garcia et al.",L373399411 2014-07-07 2014-07-14,10.1371/journal.pone.0100250,messenger RNA;adult;allele;allele exclusion;allele specific gene expression;animal cell;article;cell nucleus transplantation;chromosome 4;embryo;female;fish genetics;gene expression;gene expression regulation;gene repression;genetic model;genetic similarity;genetic transcription;genetic variability;liver;mathematical analysis;nonhuman;Oryzias latipes;RNA isolation;RNA sequence;sequence analysis;sex difference;single nucleotide polymorphism;strain difference;triploidy;Alleles,,

While the elderly are most severely affected, implicating an age bias, a striking factor in the demographics of this deadly disease is the gender bias, with higher numbers of cases, greater disease severity, and higher death rates among men than women across the lifespan. While pre-existing comorbidities and social, behavioral, and lifestyle factors contribute to this bias, biological factors underlying the host immune response may be crucial contributors.

Therefore, more understanding of the sex-specific mechanisms that lead to ischemic stroke and aggravation of secondary damage after stroke is needed. Our current mechanistic understanding of cerebral ischemia states that endothelial quiescence in neurovascular units (NVUs) is a major physiological parameter affecting the cellular response to neuron, astrocyte and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) injury. Although a hallmark of the response to injury in these cells is transcriptional activation, noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs exhibit cell-type and context dependent regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. This review assesses whether sex-specific microRNA expression (either derived from X-chromosome loci following incomplete X-chromosome inactivation or regulated by estrogen in their biogenesis) in these cells controls NVU quiescence, and as such, could differentiate stroke pathophysiology in women compared to men. Their adverse expression was found to decrease tight junction affinity in endothelial cells and activate VSMC proliferation, while their regulation of paracrine astrocyte signaling was shown to neutralize sex-specific apoptotic pathways in neurons. As such, these microRNAs have cell type-specific functions in astrocytes and vascular cells which act on one another, thereby affecting the cell viability of neurons. Furthermore, these microRNAs display actual and potential clinical implications as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in ischemic stroke and in predicting therapeutic response to antiplatelet therapy. In conclusion, this review improves the current mechanistic understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to ischemic stroke in women and highlights the clinical promise of sex-specific microRNAs as novel diagnostic biomarkers for (silent) ischemic stroke.",L2014363403 2021-11-24 2022-06-15,10.3390/ijms222111888,antithrombocytic agent;biological marker;estrogen;microRNA;anticoagulant therapy;apoptosis;astrocyte;biogenesis;blood brain barrier;brain injury;brain ischemia;brain nerve cell;cell proliferation;cell viability;disease exacerbation;disease severity;endothelium cell;gene expression;human;ischemic stroke;neuroapoptosis;nonhuman;pathophysiology;review;sex chromosome mosaicism;sex difference;tight junction;treatment response;vascular smooth muscle cell;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Stroke,,

Lineage determination restricts expression biases between the sexes, but the epigenetic differences are less constrained and can be perpetuated, accounting for dimorphisms that arise later in life. In this way, sexual identity is registered in the epigenome very early in development. As development progresses, sex-specific regulatory modules are harbored within shared transcriptional networks that delineate common traits. In reviewing this field, I propose that analyzing the mechanisms for sexual dimorphisms at the molecular and biochemical level and incorporating developmental and environmental factors will lead to a greater understanding of sex differences in health and disease.

Women with FD often show highly heterogeneous symptoms that can manifest from mild to severe phenotype. Main body: The phenotypic variability of the clinical manifestations in heterozygous women with FD mainly depends on the degree and direction of inactivation of the X chromosome. Classical approaches to measure XCI skewness might be not sufficient to explain disease manifestation in women. In addition to unbalanced XCI, allele-specific DNA methylation at promoter of GLA gene may influence the expression levels of the mutated allele, thus impacting the onset and the outcome of FD. In this regard, analyses of DNA methylation at GLA promoter, performed by approaches allowing distinction between mutated and non-mutated allele, may be much more informative. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate recent literature articles addressing the potential role of DNA methylation in the context of FD. Although up to date relatively few works have addressed this point, reviewing all pertinent studies may help to evaluate the importance of DNA methylation analysis in FD and to develop new research and technologies aimed to predict whether the carrier females will develop symptoms. Conclusions: Relatively few studies have addressed the complexity of DNA methylation landscape in FD that remains poorly investigated. The hope for the future is that ad hoc and ultradeep methylation analyses of GLA gene will provide epigenetic signatures able to predict whether pre-symptomatic female carriers will develop symptoms thus helping timely interventions.",L2010356536 2021-02-10 2021-02-16,10.1186/s13148-021-01019-3,alpha galactosidase;calcitonin gene related peptide;calcitonin receptor;genomic DNA;globotriaosylceramide;autosome;bisulfite sequencing;disease severity;DNA methylation;enzyme replacement;Fabry disease;family history;gene;GLA gene;heterozygote;human;nanopore sequencing;neuropathic pain;phenotypic variation;point mutation;priority journal;promoter region;review;Sanger sequencing;sex difference;X chromosome inactivation;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Fabry Disease;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation,,

Yet whether the resulting sex differences are perpetuated throughout development and how they connect to the sex-specific expression patterns in adult tissues is not known. There is a dearth of information on the timing and continuity of sex biases during development. It is also unclear whether sex-specific selection operates during embryogenesis. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that all adult tissues exhibit sex-specific expression patterns, some of which are independent of hormonal influence and due to intrinsic regulatory effects of the sex chromosome constitution. There are many diseases with origins during embryogenesis that also exhibit sex biases. Epigenetics has provided us with viable mechanisms to explain how the genome stores the memory of developmental events. We propose that some of these marks can be traced back to the sex chromosomes, which interact with the autosomes and establish sex-specific epigenetic features soon after fertilization. Sex-biased epigenetic marks that linger after reprograming may reveal themselves at the transcriptional level at later developmental stages and possibly, throughout the lifespan.

The expression of most X-borne genes is equalized between XX females and XY males in therian mammals (marsupials and ""placentals"") by inactivating one X chromosome in female somatic cells. However, compensation seems not to be strictly required to equalize the expression of most Z-borne genes between ZZ male and ZW female birds. Whether dosage compensation operates in the third mammal lineage, the egg-laying monotremes, is of considerable interest, since the platypus has a complex sex chromosome system in which five X and five Y chromosomes share considerable genetic homology with the chicken ZW sex chromosome pair, but not with therian XY chromosomes. The assignment of genes to four platypus X chromosomes allowed us to examine X dosage compensation in this unique species. Quantitative PCR showed a range of compensation, but SNP analysis of several X-borne genes showed that both alleles are transcribed in a heterozygous female. Transcription of 14 BACs representing 19 X-borne genes was examined by RNA-FISH in female and male fibroblasts. An autosomal control gene was expressed from both alleles in nearly all nuclei, and four pseudoautosomal BACs were usually expressed from both alleles in male as well as female nuclei, showing that their Y loci are active. However, nine X-specific BACs were usually transcribed from only one allele. This suggests that while some genes on the platypus X are not dosage compensated, other genes do show some form of compensation via stochastic transcriptional inhibition, perhaps representing an ancestral system that evolved to be more tightly controlled in placental mammals such as human and mouse. © 2008 Deakin et al.",L352076458 2008-09-05,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000140,animal cell;article;female;fibroblast;gene dosage;gene frequency;gene function;male;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;platypus (mammal);reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction;sex difference;single nucleotide polymorphism;transcription regulation;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome,,

The predominant clinical presentation of IRIS is an infectious disease that can be life-threatening. IRIS-related infectious events are distributed similarly between adult males and females, albeit a few studies have shown a skewing toward the male sex in pediatric IRIS. Here, we assessed sex-specific differences in the causes and extent of IRIS infectious events in HIV-infected pediatric patients on ART. We carried out a prospective clinical analysis (from 2000 to 2018) of IRIS-related infectious events after ART in a cohort of 82 Brazilian children and adolescents infected with HIV-1 through mother-to-child transmission as well as a comprehensive cross-referencing with public records on IRIS-related infectious causes in pediatric HIV/AIDS. Twelve events fulfilling the criteria of IRIS occurred exclusively in 11 females in our cohort. The median age at IRIS events was 3.6 years. The infectious causes included Mycobacterium bovis, varicella-zoster virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, human papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In one female, there was regional bacillus Calmette-Guérin dissemination and cytomegalovirus esophagitis. There was complete health recovery after 10 IRIS events without the use of corticosteroids or ART interruption. One case of IRIS-associated miliary tuberculosis was fatal. The biological female sex was a significant risk factor for IRIS events (odds ratio: 23.67; 95% confidence interval 95%: 1.341-417.7; P = 0.0016 and P < 0.01 by the multivariable analysis). We observed an effect of the advanced HIV/AIDS variable in IRIS females as compared with non-IRIS females (mean CD4+ T cell percentage 13.36 vs. 18.63%; P = 0.0489 and P < 0.05 by the multivariable analysis), underpinning the exclusively skewed distribution toward the female sex of this cohort. Moreover, the IRIS females in our cohort had higher mean CD4+ T cell percentages before (13.36%) and after IRIS (26.56%) than those of the IRIS females (before IRIS, 4.978%; after IRIS, 13.81%) in previous studies conducted worldwide.

No therapeutics alter disease progression. Developing therapeutics requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is possibly due to a partial loss of TAF1 function. While all XDP males are usually affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight stem cell lines from XDP female carrier individuals. Furthermore, we found that, uniquely in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression decreases after adolescence in healthy humans. We hypothesize that the decrease of TAF1 after adolescence in human caudate, in general, may underlie the vulnerability of the adult neostriatum in XDP.","2373-2822 D'Ignazio, Laura Jacomini, Ricardo S Qamar, Bareera Benjamin, Kynon J M Orcid: 0000-0003-2016-4646 Arora, Ria Sawada, Tomoyo Evans, Taylor A Diffenderfer, Kenneth E Pankonin, Aimee R Hendriks, William T Hyde, Thomas M Kleinman, Joel E Weinberger, Daniel R Bragg, D Cristopher Paquola, Apua C M Erwin, Jennifer A Orcid: 0000-0002-6784-9290 T32 MH015330/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States Journal Article United States 2022/07/23 eNeuro. 2022 Jul 21;9(4):ENEURO.0129-22.2022. doi: 10.1523/ENEURO.0129-22.2022.",10.1523/eneuro.0129-22.2022,SVA retrotransposon;X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism;induced pluripotent stem cells;movement disorder;neurodegeneration;repeat expansion;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

However, random XCI results in expression of both alleles in most females. Allelic imbalances have been used genome-wide to detect mono-allelically expressed genes. Analysis of X-linked allelic imbalance in females with skewed XCI offers the opportunity to identify genes that escape XCI with bi-allelic expression in contrast to those with mono-allelic expression and which are therefore subject to XCI.Results: We determine XCI status for 409 genes, all of which have at least five informative females in our dataset. The majority of genes are subject to XCI and genes that escape from XCI show a continuum of expression from the inactive X. Inactive X expression corresponds to differences in the level of histone modification detected by allelic imbalance after chromatin immunoprecipitation. Differences in XCI between populations and between cell lines derived from different tissues are observed.Conclusions: We demonstrate that allelic imbalance can be used to determine an inactivation status for X-linked genes, even without completely non-random XCI. There is a range of expression from the inactive X. Genes escaping XCI, including those that do so in only a subset of females, cluster together, demonstrating that XCI and location on the X chromosome are related. In addition to revealing mechanisms involved in cis-gene regulation, determining which genes escape XCI can expand our understanding of the contributions of X-linked genes to sexual dimorphism. © 2013 Cotton et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",L52848554 2013-11-08 2013-12-18,10.1186/gb-2013-14-11-r122,"allelic imbalance;article;chromatin immunoprecipitation;female;gene control;gene expression;histone modification;human;single nucleotide polymorphism;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;X Chromosome;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,

The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission presents diversity of human host and increased disease risk with advancing age, highlighting the importance of in depth understanding of its biological properties. Structural analyses have elucidated hot spots in viral binding domains, mutations and specific proteins in the host such as the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to be implicated in cell entry and viral infectivity. Furthermore, epigenetic changes that regulate chromatin structure have shown a major impact in genome stabilization and maintenance of cellular homeostasis and they have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the virus infection. Epigenetic research has revealed that global DNA methylation along with ACE2 gene methylation and post-translational histone modifications may drive differences in host tissue-, biological age- and sex-biased patterns of viral infection. Moreover, modulation of the host cells epigenetic landscape following infection represents a molecular tool used by viruses to antagonize cellular signaling as well as sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs in order to enhance viral replication and infection efficiency.

The X-linked monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) was considered as a susceptibility gene to substance abuse of tobacco, but the evolutionary effect of MAOA may lead to a positive or negative association between genetic variations and smoking development among study regions. Methods Based on linkage disequilibrium (LD), we performed a haplotype-based association to explore the effect of MAOA gene on women's smoking risk in a case-control study. Results Genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MAOA gene, rs5953210G>A, rs2283725A>G and rs1137070T>C, were significantly associated with current smoking risk in women, and the increased level of plasma MAO-A activity was raised with per copy increment of risk allele in current smokers (P < .01). The haplotype patterns with minor haplotype frequency >.05 were constructed using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and the haplotype-specific A-G-C pattern raised the 2-fold risk to develop regular smoking (P = .0005). In the diplotype analysis based on X-inactivation mechanism relative to no and full dosage compensation, we showed that A-G-C haplotype not only increased regular smoking risk in a dose-dependent manner (P-trend = .0011) but also contributed to smoking risk in the dosage compensation mechanism. Compared to non-smokers, the effect of A-G-C haplotype on random X-activation was associated with the raised MAO-A activity in women smokers (P < .05) although the lifetime cigarette consumption showed a difference that was not statistically significant.

Paradoxically, the numbers of anti-viral natural killer (NK) cells are increased in males compared to females. Using samples from mice and humans, we demonstrate that while numbers of male NK cells are increased compared to females, they display impaired production of the anti-viral cytokine IFN-γ. These sex differences were not due solely to divergent levels of gonadal hormones, since these differences persisted in gonadectomized mice. Instead, these differences can be attributed to lower male expression of X-linked Kdm6a (UTX), an epigenetic regulator which escapes X inactivation in female NK cells. NK cell-specific UTX deletion in females phenocopied multiple features of male NK cells, which include increased numbers and reduced IFN-γ production. Integrative ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis revealed a critical role for UTX in the regulation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression at loci important in NK cell homeostasis and effector function. Consequently, NK cell-intrinsic UTX levels are critical for optimal anti-viral immunity, since mice with NK cell-intrinsic UTX deficiency show increased lethality to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) challenge. Taken together, these data implicate UTX as a critical molecular determinant of NK cell sex differences and suggest enhancing UTX function as a new strategy to boost endogenous NK cell anti-viral responses.",L2018217537 2022-06-07,10.1101/2022.04.21.489076,adult;animal experiment;animal tissue;chromatin;controlled study;epigenetics;female;gene deletion;gene expression;homeostasis;human;lethality;male;mouse;Murine cytomegalovirus;natural killer cell;nonhuman;protein expression;RNA sequencing;sex difference;virus immunity;X chromosome inactivation;antivirus agent;cytokine;endogenous compound;gamma interferon;sex hormone;Sex Characteristics,,

Gender influences clinical presentations and markers in inflammatory diseases. In many chronic conditions, frequency of complications is greater in females, suggesting that continuous inflammatory reaction may induce greater damage in targeted organs and functions. Methods. To investigate gender dimorphism at a cellular level, we evaluated the production of cytokines implicated in inflammatory processes (IL-1, IL-6, PGE-2 and TNF alpha), in healthy prepubescent children of both sex and Turner's syndrome (TS) patients (genotype XO). We used stimulation by LPS (0.2 and 1 ng/ml) and Pokeweed Mitogen (PWM) on overnight cultures from whole blood samples, collected in 57 subjects: 22 girls/26 boys (5-96 months), and 9 TS patients (6-15 years). The primary outcome was to evaluate if gender influences the production of cytokines, with potential relation to X chromosome monosomy. Secondary endpoints were to relate different cytokines level productions and conditions. Results. We confirm the male over female increased cytokine productions already observed in adults. This is contrasting with numerous observations obtained in vivo about increased production of inflammatory markers in females (CRP, ESR and neutrophil counts), as we recently reported in children. Relative variations of the dimorphism according to stimulus, its concentration and cytokine type are discussed, presenting IL6 with a modulating function that could be more potent in males. TS subjects follow mostly the male pattern of reactivity, sustaining the role of some gene expression differing with X chromosome monosomy and disomy. Conclusions. Persistence of the latter dimorphism throughout life casts doubts on its direct relationship with individual hormonal status, as already documented by others in vitro, and supports the need for alternative hypothesis, such as the influence of X chromosome gene products escaping X inactivation in females and absent in subjects with X monosomy (males, TS). © 2010 Casimir et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",L50939564 2010-06-10 2010-07-22,10.1186/1476-9255-7-28,"cytokine;gene product;interleukin 1;interleukin 6;lipopolysaccharide;pokeweed mitogen;prostaglandin E2;tumor necrosis factor;adolescent;article;blood cell;blood culture;cell stimulation;child;clinical article;controlled study;cytokine production;disomy;female;gene expression;genotype;human;in vitro study;infant;inflammation;karyotype 45,X;male;monosomy X;normal human;outcome assessment;prepuberty;sex difference;Turner syndrome;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Inflammation",,

One such example is that a year after her original 1961 hypothesis she proposed that genes with Y homologues should escape from X inactivation to achieve dosage compensation between males and females. Fifty-five years later we have learned many details about these escapees that we attempt to summarize in this review, with a particular focus on recent findings. We now know that escapees are not rare, particularly on the human X, and that most lack functionally equivalent Y homologues, leading to their increasingly recognized role in sexually dimorphic traits. Newer sequencing technologies have expanded profiling of primary tissues that will better enable connections to sex-biased disorders as well as provide additional insights into the X-inactivation process. Chromosome organization, nuclear location and chromatin environments distinguish escapees from other X-inactivated genes. Nevertheless, several big questions remain, including what dictates their distinct epigenetic environment, the underlying basis of species differences in escapee regulation, how different classes of escapees are distinguished, and the roles that local sequences and chromosome ultrastructure play in escapee regulation.

Our results show that the lack of NEK1 provokes an abnormal organization of the meiosis I spindle characterized by elongated and/or multipolar spindles, and abnormal chromosome congression. The aberrant spindle structure is concomitant with the disruption in localization and protein levels of myosin X (MYO10) and alpha-adducin (ADD1), both of which are implicated in the regulation of spindle formation during mitosis. Interaction of ADD1 with MYO10 is dependent on phosphorylation, whereby phosphorylation of ADD1 enables its binding to MYO10 on mitotic spindles.

Cells in this extraembryonic compartment match the chromosomal sex of the embryo itself. Sex differences have been observed in common gestational pathologies, highlighting the importance of maternal immune tolerance to the fetal compartment. Over the past decade, several studies examining placentas from term pregnancies have revealed widespread sex differences in hormone signaling, immune signaling, and metabolic functions. Given the rapid and dynamic development of the human placenta, sex differences that exist at term (37-42 weeks gestation) are unlikely to align precisely with those present at earlier stages when the fetal-maternal interface is being formed and the foundations of a healthy or diseased pregnancy are established. While fetal sex as a variable is often left unreported in studies performing transcriptomic profiling of the first-trimester human placenta, four recent studies have specifically examined fetal sex in early human placental development.

FBXL10 is expressed as two isoforms: FBXL10-1, a longer form that contains an N-terminal histone demethylase domain with C-terminal F-box, CXXC, PHD, RING, and leucinerich repeat domains, and FBXL10-2, a shorter form that initiates at an alternative internal exon and which lacks the histone demethylase domain but retains all other annotated domains. Selective deletion of Fbxl10-1 had been reported to produce a low penetrance and variable phenotype; most of the mutant animals were essentially normal. We constructed mutant mouse strains that were either null for Fbxl10-2 but wild type for Fbxl10-1 or null for both Fbxl10-1 and Fbxl10-2. Results: Deletion of Fbxl10-2 (in a manner that does not perturb expression of Fbxl10-1) produced a phenotype very different from the Fbxl10-1 mutant, with craniofacial abnormalities, neural tube defects, and increased lethality, especially in females. Mutants that lacked both FBXL10-1 and FBXL10-2 showed embryonic lethality and even more extreme sexual dimorphism, with more severe gene dysregulation in mutant female embryos. X-linked genes were most severely dysregulated, and there was marked overexpression of Xist in mutant females although genes that encode factors that bind to Xist RNA were globally downregulated in mutant female as compared to male embryos. Conclusions: FBXL10 is the first factor shown to be required both for the normal expression and function of the Xist gene and for normal expression of proteins that associate with Xist RNA; it is proposed that FBXL10 coordinates the expression of Xist RNA with proteins that associate with this RNA. The function of FBXL10 is largely independent of the histone demethylase activity of the long form of the protein.",L613934413 2017-01-06 2017-01-31,10.1186/s13072-016-0069-1,chromosome protein;FBXL10 protein;RNA;unclassified drug;animal experiment;animal model;animal tissue;article;binding affinity;binding site;chromosome aberration;controlled study;craniofacial malformation;disease activity;down regulation;embryo;embryotoxicity;Fbxl10 1 gene;Fbxl10 2 gene;FBXL10 gene;female;gene;gene function;male;molecular dynamics;molecular pathology;mouse;neural tube defect;nonhuman;phenotype;priority journal;protein determination;protein function;RNA binding;sex difference;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome,,

Methods: Using reverse phase protein arrays, levels of similar to 100 proteins/protein modifications were measured in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex of female and male controls and their trisomic Dp10 littermates. Proteins were chosen for their known roles in learning/memory and synaptic plasticity and include components of the MAPK, MTOR, and apoptosis pathways, immediate early genes, and subunits of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Protein levels were compared between genotypes, sexes, and brain regions using a three-level mixed effects model and the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. Results: In control mice, levels of approximately one half of the proteins differ significantly between females and males in at least one brain region; in the hippocampus alone, levels of 40 % of the proteins are significantly higher in females. Trisomy of the Mmu10 segment differentially affects female and male profiles, perturbing protein levels most in the cerebellum of female Dp10 and most in the hippocampus of male Dp10. Cortex is minimally affected by sex and genotype. Diverse pathways and processes are implicated in both sex and genotype differences. Conclusions: The extensive sex differences in control mice in levels of proteins involved in learning/memory illustrate the molecular complexity underlying sex differences in normal neurological processes. The sex-specific abnormalities in the Dp10 suggest the possibility of sex-specific phenotypic features in DS and reinforce the need to use female as well as male mice, in particular in preclinical evaluations of drug responses.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 25 Total Times Cited: 25 Cited Reference Count: 89,10.1186/s13293-015-0043-9,Trisomy 21;Dp(10)1Yey;Mouse chromosome 10;Hippocampus;Learning and memory deficits;TRPM2;S100B;Cerebellum;Intellectual disability;GENE-EXPRESSION;TRPM2 CHANNELS;CHROMOSOME COMPLEMENT;COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE;NEURITE OUTGROWTH;X-INACTIVATION;RECEPTOR;FLUOXETINE;MICE;ACTIVATION;Sex Characteristics;Brain,,

M. and Rosenfeld, C. S.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L70811078&from=export,,,,"Preimplantation development is a key period for the establishment of epigenetic marks, as complete epigenetic reprogramming involving DNA methylation and histone modifications occurs from the gametes to the blastocyst stage. The changing epigenetic landscape makes preimplantation embryos especially vulnerable to modifications of the epigenome initiated by assisted reproduction techniques or factors, such as maternal diet and exposure to toxic compounds. Such changes may result in long term developmental and health consequences for the offspring, which can be manifested in a sex-specific manner. Additionally, preimplantation bovine embryos are known to display sexual dimorphism in transcription of certain genes with roles in DNA methylation and regulation of transcription, and these differences correlate with the extent of methylation of specific sequences. The aim of this study has been to compare the sex-related differences in the expression of nine genes implicated in epigenetic regulation in mouse blastocysts. In vivo derived blastocysts were obtained from CD1 females mated with Tg(CAG-EGFP)D4Nagy/J males, which have a copy of a GFP gene inserted into their X chromosome, thereby allowing males and females to be distinguished under a fluorescent microscope. Five groups of 10 embryos of each sex were used in the analyses. PolyA RNA was extracted by Dynabeads. After revese transcription, mRNA abundance relative to the housekeeping gene, H2afz, was obtained by qPCR. The genes analyzed were related with maintenance (Dnmt1) or de novo (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) DNA methylation, DNA demethylation (Mbd2 and Mbd3), and two pairs of sex chromosome encoded genes related with histone demethylation of H3K27 (Kdm6a - previously known as Utx- and Uty) and H3K4 (Kdm5c - previously known as Jarid1c- and Kdm5d - Jarid1d-). The expression level of the 4 genes with roles in DNA methylation did not differ between sexes. However, the two X-linked genes, Kdm6a and Kdm5c, escaped X inactivation and were overexpressed in females (ANOVA P<0.05; male vs female, mean ± SEM; Kdm6a 1 ± 0.1 vs 1.83 ± 0.1; Kdm5c 1 ± 0.1 vs 1.54 ± 0.1); whereas, the expression of the two Y-linked (Uty and Kdm5d) genes was, as expected, restricted to males. The mRNA and protein sequences of both gene pairs and their proteins have diverged over evolution, specially in the case of KDM6A/UTY (KDM5C/KDM5D proteins 80% identity, 95% coverage; KDM6A/UTY proteins 77% identity, 85% coverage), which may indicate a functional divergence. Interestingly, H3K27me3 is involved in X-chromosome inactivation and, recently, it has been proposed to exert a major role in ICM/TE differentiation and ES derivation. The sexually dimorphic patterns in the expression of these genes may explain the differences in susceptibilities to epigenetic modifications between male and female embryos, and a possible effect of sex chromosome dosage on pluripotency and differentiation.",L70811078 2012-07-20,,protein;DNA;messenger RNA;toxic substance;histone;CD1 antigen;RNA;gene;mouse;society;sex difference;female;male;DNA methylation;embryo;blastocyst;identity;sex chromosome;demethylation;X chromosome inactivation;histone modification;gamete;amino acid sequence;exposure;maternal nutrition;progeny;infertility therapy;X chromosome;preimplantation embryo;microscope;housekeeping gene;methylation;landscape;health,,

In one of these (chronic myeloid leukemia), there is an associated pathognomonic chromosomal abnormality known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This leads to constitutive tyrosine kinase activity which is responsible for the disease and is used as a target for effective therapy. This review concentrates on the search in the other conditions (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic mylofibrosis) for a similar biological marker with therapeutic potential. There is no obvious chromosomal marker in these conditions and yet evidence of clonality can be obtained in females by the use of X-inactivation patterns. PRV-1mRNA over expression, raised vitamin B12 levels and raised neutrophil alkaline phosphatase scores are evidence that cells in these conditions have received excessive signals for proliferation, maturation and reduced apoptosis. The ability of erythroid colonies to grow spontaneously without added external erythropoietin in some cases, provided a useful marker and a clue to this abnormal signaling. In the past year several important discoveries have been made which go a long way in elucidating the involved pathways. The recently discovered JAK2 V617F mutation which occurs in the majority of cases of polycythemia vera and in about half of the cases with the two other conditions, enables constitutive tyròsine kinase activity without the need for ligand binding to hematopoietic receptors. This mutation has become the biological marker for these conditions and has spurred the development of a specific therapy to neutralize its effects. The realization that inherited mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) can cause a phenotype of thrombocytosis such as in Mpl Baltimore (K39N) and in a Japanese family with S505A, has prompted the search for acquired mutations in this receptor in chronic myeloproliferative disease. Recently, two mutations have been found; W515L and W515K. These mutations have been evident in patients with essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis but not in polycythemia vera. They presumably act by causing constitutional, activating conformational changes in the receptor. The discovery of JAK2 and Mpl mutations is leading to rapid advancements in understanding the pathophysiology and in the treatment of these diseases. © 2006 Bennett and Stroncek; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",L44741153 2006-11-29,10.1186/1479-5876-4-41,alkaline phosphatase;BCR ABL protein;biological marker;CD59 antigen;cyanocobalamin;erythropoietin;Janus kinase 2;lymphocyte antigen receptor;messenger RNA;protein prv 1;protein tyrosine kinase;thrombopoietin receptor;unclassified drug;apoptosis;cell maturation;cell proliferation;chromosome marker;chronic disease;clonal variation;conformational transition;enzyme activity;erythroid cell;family history;gene mutation;gene overexpression;human;Japan;ligand binding;myeloid metaplasia;myeloproliferative disorder;neutrophil;pathophysiology;phenotype;polycythemia vera;review;scoring system;sex difference;signal transduction;thrombocytosis;thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura;X chromosome inactivation,,

Differences exist in respect to the anatomic localization of melanoma, in that it is more frequent on the trunk in men and on the lower limbs in women. A debated issue is if-and to what extent-melanoma development can be attributed to gender-specific behaviors or to biologically intrinsic differences. In the search for factors responsible for the divergences, a pivotal role of sex hormones has been observed, although conflicting results indicate the involvement of other mechanisms. The presence on the X chromosome of numerous miRNAs and coding genes playing immunological roles represents another important factor, whose relevance can be even increased by the incomplete X chromosome random inactivation. Considering the known advantages of the female immune system, a different cancer immune surveillance efficacy was suggested to explain some sex disparities. Indeed, the complexity of this picture emerged when the recently developed immunotherapies unexpectedly showed better improvements in men than in women.

We hypothesize that nonsyndromic or “essential” autism involves extreme male bias in infants who are genetically normal, but they develop deficiency of carnitine and perhaps other nutrients in the brain causing autism that may be amenable to early reversal and prevention. That brain carnitine deficiency might cause autism is suggested by reports of severe carnitine deficiency in autism and by evidence that TMLHE deficiency − a defect in carnitine biosynthesis − is a risk factor for autism. A gene on the X chromosome (SLC6A14) likely escapes random X-inactivation (a mixed epigenetic and genetic regulation) and could limit carnitine transport across the blood-brain barrier in boys compared to girls. A mixed, common gene variant-environment hypothesis is proposed with diet, minor illnesses, microbiome, and drugs as possible risk modifiers. The hypothesis can be tested using animal models and by a trial of carnitine supplementation in siblings of probands.

Multiple studies have provided inactivation status calls for a large subset of the genes on the X chromosome; however, these studies vary in which genes they were able to make calls for and in some cases which call they give a specific gene. Methods: This analysis aggregated three published studies that have examined X chromosome inactivation status of genes across the X chromosome, generating consensus calls and identifying discordancies. The impact of expression level and chromosomal location on X chromosome inactivation status was also assessed. Results: Overall, we assigned a consensus XCI status 639 genes, including 78 % of protein-coding genes expressed outside of the testes, with a lower frequency for non-coding RNA and testis-specific genes. Study-specific discordancies suggest that there may be instability of XCI during cell culture and also highlight study-specific variations in call type. We observe an enrichment of discordant genes at boundaries between genes subject to and escaping from inactivation.

Here, using a paradigmatic cohort of KS and HGA induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying 49,XXXXY, 48,XXXY, and 47,XXY karyotypes, we identified the genes within the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) as the most susceptible to dosage-dependent transcriptional dysregulation and therefore potentially responsible for the progressively worsening phenotype in higher grade X aneuploidies. By contrast, the biallelically expressed non-PAR escape genes displayed high interclonal and interpatient variability in iPSCs and differentiated derivatives, suggesting that these genes could be associated with variable KS traits. By interrogating KS and HGA iPSCs at the single-cell resolution we showed that PAR1 and non-PAR escape genes are not only resilient to the X-inactive specific transcript (XIST)-mediated inactivation but also that their transcriptional regulation is disjointed from the absolute XIST expression level.

In therian mammals, all sex differences are downstream of the unequal effects of XX vs. XY sex chromosomes. Three major categories of sex-biasing factors are activational and organizational effects of gonadal hormones, and sex chromosome effects operating outside of the gonads. These three types of effects can be discriminated from each other with established experimental designs and animal models. Two important mouse models, which allow conclusions regarding the sex-biasing effects of sex chromosome complement, interacting with gonadal hormone effects, are the Four Core Genotypes model and the XY* model. Chromosome Y consomic strains give information about the role of the Y chromosome. An important recent change in sexual differentiation theory is the increasing realization that sex-biasing factors can counteract the effects of each other, reducing rather than producing sex differences in phenotype. This change in viewpoint rationalizes a change in experimental strategies for dissecting sex chromosome effects.

Epilepsy, sensory hypersensitivities, and several other neuropsychiatric symptoms are also common in FXS and ASD. FXS is caused by a >200 CGG-repeat on the FMR1 gene, located on the X-chromosome, that silences its transcription, preventing expression of the protein, FMRP. Possessing a single X-chromosome, FXS occurs more frequently in males than females. Males with FXS typically have more severe clinical symptoms than females with FXS. For example, males are more than twice as likely to have epilepsy. Genetic mosaicism (X-inactivation) in females with FXS is the presumed, exclusive reason for the lower symptom severity. Our results presented here challenge this presumption. During preclinical testing of Fmr1 knock-out mice, we observed a statistically significant, higher prevalence of audiogenic seizures in juvenile (P23- P25), male Fmr1 knock-out mice (89%) compared to juvenile, female Fmr1 knock-out mice (50%) (P=0.01, N=19 males and N=18 females), closely paralleling the sex difference in epilepsy prevalence in FXS. Importantly, however, female Fmr1 knock-out mice are homozygous for the mutated Fmr1 gene, and therefore, like male Fmr1 knock-out mice, do not express FMRP. We also found that expression of the serotonin receptor, 5-HT1AR, was significantly elevated in whole brains of adult, male Fmr1 knock-out mice, compared to wild-type mice (P=0.04, N=8 each); we did not observe this difference in female mice (P=0.24, N=7 each). We are currently investigating whether 5-HT1ARs contribute to the sex difference in audiogenic seizure susceptibility. In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that the reduced symptom severity in females with FXS may not be solely attributed to X-inactivation of the mutated FMR1 allele.",L637862395 2022-05-03,10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.06309,endogenous compound;fragile X mental retardation protein;serotonin receptor;adolescent;adult;allele;animal experiment;animal model;audiogenic seizure;brain;conference abstract;controlled study;epilepsy;female;fragile X syndrome;gene expression;gene frequency;genetic association;homozygosity;human;juvenile;knockout mouse;male;mosaicism;mouse;nonhuman;preclinical study;prevalence;protein expression;sex difference;wild type mouse;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Mice;Sex Characteristics,,

One important biological factor underlying this sex bias is the X-chromosome, which is enriched for immunity-related genes. Female mammals use X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) to generate a transcriptionally silent inactive X-chromosome enriched with heterochromatic modifications and the long noncoding RNA Xist, which equalizes gene expression between the sexes. We have discovered that XCI is maintained differently in female lymphocytes from mice and humans, where Xist RNA and heterochromatic modifications dynamically associate with the inactive X-chromosome. Mature naïve B cells are missing Xist RNA and heterochromatin marks on the inactive X, and these marks return to most cells with in vitro stimulation. We found that the chromatin of the inactive X changes during early B cell commitment, at the pro-B cell stage, initiated by the loss of Xist RNA localization. In mature lymphocytes, we found evidence of biallelic expression and increased dosage of immunity-related X-linked genes including TLR7 and CXCR3, in support of relaxed transcriptional silence from the inactive X. During B cell activation, Xist RNA is relocalized to the inactive X by the transcription factor YY1, in a novel two-step process unique to B cells. YY1-mediated relocalization of Xist RNA during B cell stimulation is necessary for enrichment of heterochromatin modifications and maintenance of X-linked gene silencing. Furthermore, we examined lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disorder with a strong female bias, and observed mislocalized XIST RNA transcripts and evidence of biallelic expression of immunity-related genes from both X-chromosomes.

Sex chromosome abnormalities, such as Turner's syndrome (monosomy X), are associated with aortic vascular disease. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an XY sex chromosome complement in females promotes AngII-induced AAAs. In addition, as previous studies demonstrated that testosterone promotes AngII-induced AAAs in male mice, we determined if testosterone would augment AAA severity in XY females. Methods and Results: Transgenic male mice with deletion of Sry from the Y-chromosome expressing Sry on autosomes (8-12 weeks of age) were bred to female Ldlr-/-mice to generate female mice with an XY or an XX sex chromosome complement. Female mice (XX and XY) were fed a Western diet and segregated into sham and ovariectomized (OVX) groups. Two weeks later, mice were implanted with osmotic minipumps to infuse AngII (1,000 ng/kg/min) for 28 days. The AAA incidence (XX sham, 40%; XX OVX 29%; XY sham, 71%; XY OVX, 57%, p=0.031) and rupture rate (XX sham, 0%; XX OVX 0%; XY sham, 35%; XY OVX, 29%, p=0.003) were significantly increased in XY compared to XX females. Internal abdominal aortic lumen diameters were significantly increased in XY OVX versus XX OVX female mice at day 27 (XY, 2.31 ± 0.14; XX, 1.58 ± 0.2, p= 0.009). Moreover, AAA external diameters were significantly increased in XY OVX versus XX OVX females (XY, 2.34 ± 0.15; XX, 1.71 ± 0.18, p=0.0004). Administration of testosterone to adult female XY mice as well as neonatal female mice markedly enhanced AAA rupture (maximum of 73%). DNA microarrays of abdominal aortas revealed that male specific genes on the Y chromosome and inflammatory genes were enriched in aortas from XY females, while genes that escape X-inactivation were enriched in aortas from XX females. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that an XY sex chromosome complement is sufficient to promote a high AAA incidence, and markedly increase AAA severity in female mice.

Results: A total of 18 patients (including 5 females) were identified. Six had de novo, 5 had maternally inherited mutations, and 7 had chromosomal disruptions. All females had strongly skewed X-inactivation in favor of the abnormal X-chromosome. Symptoms presented in early childhood with delayed motor development alone or in combination with seizures. Intellectual disability was severe in most and moderate in patients with milder mutations. Males with severe intellectual disability had severe, often intractable, epilepsy and exhibited a particular facial dysmorphism. Patients with mutations in exon 9 affecting the protein's PH domain did not develop epilepsy. Conclusions: ARHGEF9 encodes a crucial neuronal synaptic protein; loss of function of which results in severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and a particular facial dysmorphism. Loss of only the protein's PH domain function is associated with the absence of epilepsy.",L616975813 2017-06-30 2017-07-04,10.1212/nxg.0000000000000148,brain protein;carbamazepine;clobazam;eslicarbazepine;guanine nucleotide exchange factor;lacosamide;lamotrigine;levetiracetam;oxcarbazepine;phenobarbital;phenytoin;pregabalin;primidone;protein ARHGEF9;protein PH;sultiame;topiramate;unclassified drug;valproic acid;vigabatrin;adolescent;adult;article;child;childhood disease;chromosome damage;clinical article;disease severity;epilepsy;exon;face dysmorphia;female;gene mutation;genotype phenotype correlation;human;intellectual impairment;loss of function mutation;male;maternal inheritance;medical examination;medical history;motor dysfunction;patient identification;preschool child;priority journal;protein domain;questionnaire;school child;seizure;sex chromosome aberration;sex difference;symptomatology;X chromosome inactivation,,

J. and Newton-Bishop, J. and Tiffen, J. C. and Hersey, P.",,,,,"Background: Survival from melanoma is strongly related to patient sex, with females having a survival rate almost twice that of males. Many explanations have been proposed but have not withstood critical scrutiny. Prior analysis of different cancers with a sex bias has identified six X-linked genes that escape X chromosome inactivation in females and are, therefore, potentially involved in sex differences in survival. Four of the genes are well-known epigenetic regulators that are known to influence the expression of hundreds of other genes and signaling pathways in cancer. Methods: Survival and interaction analysis were performed on the skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), comparing high vs. low expression ofKDM6A,ATRX,KDM5C,andDDX3X. The Leeds melanoma cohort (LMC) on 678 patients with primary melanoma was used as a validation cohort. Results: Analysis of TCGA data revealed that two of these genes-KDM6AandATRX-were associated with improved survival from melanoma. TumoralKDM6Awas expressed at higher levels in females and was associated with inferred lymphoid infiltration into melanoma. Gene set analysis of highKDM6Ashowed strong associations with immune responses and downregulation of genes associated with Myc and other oncogenic pathways. The LMC analysis confirmed the prognostic significance ofKDM6Aand its interaction withEZH2but also revealed the expression ofKDM5CandDDX3Xto be prognostically significant. The analysis also confirmed a partial correlation ofKDM6Awith immune tumor infiltrates. Conclusion: When considered together, the results from these two series are consistent with the involvement of X-linked epigenetic regulators in the improved survival of females from melanoma. The identification of gene signatures associated with their expression presents insights into the development of new treatment initiatives but provides a basis for exploration in future studies.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 9 Total Times Cited: 9 Cited Reference Count: 51,10.3390/cancers12082082,melanoma;sex difference;X-linked genes;X chromosome inactivation;epigenetic regulators;histone demethylase;EZH2 inhibitor;GSEA;immune response;survival;TCGA;SKCM;LMC;EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION;DENDRITIC CELLS;POOLED ANALYSIS;EXPRESSION;STAGE;TRAFFICKING;GENDER;RNA;AGE;Melanoma,,

These sex differences have been variously attributed to hormones, sex chromosomes, genotype × sex effects, differences in behavior, and differences in environmental exposures; however, their mechanisms and underlying biology remain largely unknown. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides an opportunity to investigate the prevalence and genetic mechanisms of sex differences in the human transcriptome by surveying many tissues that have not previously been characterized in this manner. RATIONALE: To characterize sex differences in the human transcriptome and its regulation, and to discover how sex and genetics interact to influence complex traits and disease, we generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and its genetic regulation across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the GTEx project (v8 data release), analyzing 16,245 RNA-sequencing samples and genotypes of 838 adult individuals. We report sex differences in gene expression levels, tissue cell type composition, and cis expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs). To assess their impact, we integrated these results with gene function, transcription factor binding annotation, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of 87 GWASs. RESULTS: Sex effects on gene expression are ubiquitous (13,294 sex-biased genes across all tissues). However, these effects are small and largely tissue-specific. Genes with sex-differentiated expression are not primarily driven by tissue-specific gene expression and are involved in a diverse set of biological functions, such as drug and hormone response, embryonic development and tissue morphogenesis, fertilization, sexual reproduction and spermatogenesis, fat metabolism, cancer, and immune response. Whereas X-linked genes with higher expression in females suggest candidates for escape from X-chromosome inactivation, sex-biased expression of autosomal genes suggests hormone-related transcription factor regulation and a role for additional transcription factors, as well as sex-differentiated distribution of epigenetic marks, particularly histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Sex differences in the genetic regulation of gene expression are much less common (369 sex-biased eQTLs across all tissues) and are highly tissue-specific. We identified 58 gene-trait associations driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These include loci where sex-differentiated cell type abundances mediate genotype-phenotype associations, as well as loci where sex may play a more direct role in the underlying molecular mechanism of the association. For example, we identified a female-specific eQTL in liver for the hexokinase HKDC1 that influences glucose metabolism in pregnant females, which is subsequently reflected in the birth weight of the offspring. CONCLUSION: By integrating sex-aware analyses of GTEx data with gene function and transcription factor binding annotations, we describe tissue-specific and tissue-shared drivers and mechanisms contributing to sex differences in the human transcriptome and eQTLs. We discovered multiple sex-differentiated genetic effects on gene expression that colocalize with complex trait genetic associations, thereby facilitating the mechanistic interpretation of GWAS signals. Because the causative tissue is unknown for many phenotypes, analysis of the diverse GTEx tissue collection can serve as a powerful resource for investigations into the basis of sex-biased traits. This work provides an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation.",L2008035736 2020-11-26 2021-02-15,10.1126/science.Aba3066,transcriptome;adult;article;cell composition;controlled study;expression quantitative trait locus;female;gene expression;gene expression level;gene expression regulation;genetic association;genetic regulation;genome-wide association study;genotype;human;human genetics;human tissue;male;priority journal;sex difference;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Gene Expression,,
