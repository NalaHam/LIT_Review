"1",320,"Commentary on ""A Role for the X Chromosome in Sex Differences in Variability in General Intelligence?"" (Johnson et al., 2009)",2009,"Perspect Psychol Sci","Craig, I. W. and Haworth, C. M. and Plomin, R.","Johnson et al.'s (2009) article highlights the role of X-chromosomal genes in general intelligence and draws attention to their potential role in explaining the observed greater variance for this trait in males and their excess at both extremes of the distribution. We note that this would result from a simple additive effect of X-linked intelligence genes and also discuss the potentially important contribution of recessive deleterious loci. The buffering effect of heterozygosity in females will be partly constrained by the skewing of X-inactivation patterns increasing the variance of females beyond what is expected. Furthermore, escape of some X-linked genes from in-activation may also be relevant to male-female variance comparisons. We also comment on the difficulty of establishing the extent to which the X chromosome is enriched for intelligence genes and point out that their estimates of the proportion of genes influencing general intelligence that might be located on the X chromosome rely on some doubtful premises, especially concerning the likely equivalence of X-linked gene action in males and females. Finally, we discuss the increasingly compelling evidence for the accumulation of genes on the X chromosome that have selective benefit to males, including those implicated infertility and some manifestations of intelligence.","review","","","","","","intelligence","","","","x","",""
"2",339,"De novo DDX3X missense variants in males appear viable and contribute to syndromic intellectual disability",2019,"Am J Med Genet A","Nicola, P. and Blackburn, P. R. and Rasmussen, K. J. and Bertsch, N. L. and Klee, E. W. and Hasadsri, L. and Pichurin, P. N. and Rankin, J. and Raymond, F. L. and Clayton-Smith, J.","DDX3X (Xp11.4) encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase that escapes X chromosome inactivation. Pathogenic variants in DDX3X have been shown to cause X-linked intellectual disability (ID) (MRX102, MIM: 300958). The phenotypes associated with DDX3X variants are heterogeneous and include brain and behavioral abnormalities, microcephaly, hypotonia, and movement disorders and/or spasticity. The majority of DDX3X variants described are de novo mutations in females with ID. In contrast, most male DDX3X variants are inherited from an unaffected mother, with one documented exception being a recently identified de novo splice site variant. It has been suggested, therefore, that DDX3X exerts its effects through haploinsufficiency in females, and that affected males carry hypomorphic alleles that retain partial function. Given the lack of male de novo DDX3X variants, loss-of-function variants in this gene are suspected to be male lethal. Through whole-exome sequencing, we identified three unrelated males with hemizygous missense DDX3X variants and ID. All three variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, with two established as de novo. In silico analyses were supportive of pathogenicity. We report the male phenotypes and compare them to phenotypes observed in previously reported male and female patients. In conclusion, we propose that de novo DDX3X variants are not necessarily male lethal and should be considered as a cause of syndromic ID in both males and females.","experiment","DDX3X","","","","","intellectual disability, behavioral, neurological, microcephaly, hypotonia","","Sanger sequencing","","x","",""

A male fetus (Case 1) clinically presented with holoprosencephaly, cleft palate and lip, blepharophimosis, nasal bone absence, and hypolastic left heart by ultrasonography at 15 gestational weeks. Another female patient (Case 2) showed a distinct phenotype with white matter hypoplasia, cleft palate, developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID) at 7 years. Whole-exome sequencing identified de novo nonsense mutations in STAG2: c.3097C>T, p.(Arg1033*) in Case 1 and c.2229G>A, p.(Trp743*) in Case 2. X-inactivation was highly skewed in Case 2. To date, only 10 STAG2 pathogenic variants (four nonsense, four missense, and two frameshift) have been reported in patients with multiple congenital anomalies, ID, and DD. Although Case 2 showed similar clinical features to the reported female patients with STAG2 abnormalities, Case 1 showed an extremely severe phenotype, which could be explained by the first detected truncating variant in males.","experiment","STAG2","","","","","holoprosencephaly, cleft palate and lip, blepharophimosis, nasal bone absence, hypolastic left heart, intellectual disability","","case study","","","",""
"4",373,"(Putative) Sex Differences in Neuroimmune Modulation of Memory",2017,"Journal of Neuroscience Research","Tronson, N. C. and Collette, K. M.","The neuroimmune system is significantly sexually dimorphic, with sex differences evident in the number and activation states of microglia, in the activation of astrocytes, and in cytokine release and function. Neuroimmune cells and signaling are now recognized as critical for many neural functions throughout the life span, including synaptic plasticity and memory function. Here we address the question of how cytokines, astrocytes, and microglia contribute to memory, and specifically how neuroimmune modulation of memory differentially affects males and females. Understanding sex differences in both normal memory processes and dysregulation of memory in psychiatric and neurological disorders is critical for developing treatment and preventive strategies for memory disorders that are effective for both men and women.
