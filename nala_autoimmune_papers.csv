The precise mechanisms driving these sex differences in immunity are unknown. To investigate possible genetic factors, we quantify escape from X chromosome inactivation (XCI) for TLR7 and four other genes (RPS6KA3, CYBB, BTK, and IL13RA1) at the single plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) level. We observe escape from XCI for all investigated genes, leading to biallelic expression patterns. pDCs with biallelic gene expression have significantly higher mRNA levels of the respective genes. Unstimulated pDCs with biallelic TLR7 expression exhibit significantly higher IFNα/β mRNA levels, and IFNα exposure results in significantly increased IFNα/β protein production by pDCs. These results identify unanticipated heterogeneity in escape from XCI of several genes in pDCs and highlight the important contribution of X chromosome factors to sex differences in type I IFN responses, which might explain observed sex differences in human diseases.","experiment","TLR7, RPS6KA3, CYBB, BTK, IL13RA1","","","","IFN production","autoimmune","","mRNA ","","","","very relevant"

SLE is one of many autoimmune disorders that have a strong gender bias, with 70-90% of SLE patients being female. Several explanations have been postulated to account for the severity of autoimmune diseases in females, including hormonal, microbiota, and gene dosage differences. X-linked toll-like receptors (TLRs) have recently been implicated in disease progression in females. Our previous studies using the 564Igi mouse model of SLE on a Tlr7 and Tlr9 double knockout background showed that the presence of Tlr8 on both X chromosomes was required for the production of IgG autoantibodies, Ifn-I expression and granulopoiesis in females. Here, we show the results of our investigation into the role of Tlr8 expression in SLE pathogenesis in 564Igi females. Female mice have an increase in serum pathogenic anti-RNA IgG2a and IgG2b autoantibodies. 564Igi mice have also been shown to have an increase in neutrophils in vivo, which are major contributors to Ifn-Œ± expression. Here, we show that neutrophils from C57BL/6 mice express Ifn-Œ± in response to 564 immune complexes and TLR8 activation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from 564Igi females have a significant increase in Tlr8 expression compared to male-derived cells, and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization data suggest that Tlr8 may escape X-inactivation in female-derived macrophages. These results propose a model by which females may be more susceptible to SLE pathogenesis due to inefficient inactivation of Tlr8.","experiment","Tlr8","","","","EXCI","systemic lupus erythematosus","","mice","","","","relevant"

SLE incidence in female is substantially higher than males, but males tend to have more severe manifestations including greater risk of lupus nephritis (LN). Aberrant genetic expression of immune cells plays a vital role in pathogenesis of SLE and may explain gender diapariesties. We conducted bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SLE females and males with and without LN to identify gene differences and possible sex-tailored treatment. The gene expression profiling datasets (GSE 99967) were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo and analyzed by GEO2R platform. GSE 99967 used ffymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array and mRNA from whole blood. The t-test was done and adjusted P-value < 0.03 by Benjamini & Hochberg method was a threshold for statistically significant DEGs. 15 and 13 DEGs were obtained comparing SLE females with SLE males without and with LN, respectively. 13 common genes identified in both comparisons. XIST was the only down-regulated gene in male, located at X chromosome and responsible for initiation and spread of X-inactivation. X inactivation provides XIST dosage equivalence between genders. This suggested altered X-chromosome inactivation lead to female bias in SLE. Of 12 common up-regulated genes in male, 10 located at Y chromosome and showed a decrease up-regulated in SLE males with LN compare to without. A markly DEGs drop was found in TXLNGY, UTY and USP9Y, located at Yq 11.22. TXLNGY is a pseudo-gene so may not have roles in sex bias. UTY is a male-specific histone demethylase and USP9Y regulates level of protein turnover by preventing protein degradation including TGF-beta signaling. Change in UTY and USP9Y expression may associate with developing LN and drugs modifying their expression might benefit in treatment or prevention of LN in SLE males. The study enhanced an understanding of SLE sexual bias. Aberrant XIST inactivation may cause different incidence of SLE among gender. Drugs changing XIST expression might cure SLE.

M.","Women have up to a fourfold increase in risk for autoimmune disease compared to men. Many explanations have been proposed, including sex hormones, the X chromosome, microchimerism, environmental factors, and the microbiome. However, the mechanism for this autoimmune sex bias remains obscure. In this manuscript, we evaluate the hypothesis that qualitative or quantitative differences in circulating antibodies may explain, at least in part, the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and its sex bias-especially when considering an evolutionary perspective. Indeed, women have higher absolute levels of antibodies than men, and (auto)antibodies are also associated with most autoimmune diseases. Several facts suggest differences in antibodies may cause increased prevalence of autoimmune disease in women. First, the association between increased quantities of serum antibodies and increased prevalence of autoimmunity is found not only in women, but also in men with Klinefelter syndrome. Second, both serum antibody levels and autoimmunity spike in the postpartum period. Third, a dose-response effect exists between parity and both serum antibodies and prevalence of autoimmune disease. Fourth, many biologically plausible mechanisms explain the association, such as T cell-dependent activation of B cells and/or VGLL3. The evolutionary underpinning of increased antibodies in women is likely to be protection of offspring from infections. Overall, this evolutionary paradigm can help explain why the phenomenon of autoimmunity occurs preferentially in women and raises the possibility of new treatment options.","review","","","","","antibodies","autoimmune","","","","","","relevant"

In addition, we will discuss the concept of gene escape in immune cells, with examples related to specific X-linked genes and autoimmune diseases. Expert opinion There is growing evidence that many genes present on chrX escape inactivation, and some of them have significant immune-mediated functions. In immune cells of female individuals the escape of these genes is not constant, but the knowledge of the mechanisms controlling this plasticity are not completely understood.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to confirm a role for XCI skewing as a potential explanation for the strong female preponderance seen in AITD. DESIGN: The design of the study was to screen XCI in the largest GD, HT, and control case-control cohort and family cohort to date and undertake a meta-analysis of previous AITD XCI reports. SETTING: The study was conducted at a research laboratory. PATIENTS: Three hundred and nine GD, 490 HT, and 325 female UK Caucasians controls, 273 UK Caucasian GD families, and a meta-analysis of 454 GD, 673 HT, and 643 female Caucasian controls were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Case-control and family-based association studies and meta-analysis were measured. RESULTS: Skewed XCI was observed with GD [odds ratio (OR) 2.17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-3.30], P=2.1×10(-4)] and a trend toward skewing with HT (P=.08) compared with the control cohort. A meta-analysis of our UK data and that of four previous non-UK Caucasian studies confirmed significant skewing of XCI with GD [OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.58-4.10), P=1.0×10(-4), I2=30.2%] and HT [OR 2.40 (95% CI 1.10-5.26), P=.03, I2=74.3%]. CONCLUSIONS: Convincing evidence exists to support a role for skewed XCI in female subjects with AITD, which may, in part, explain the strong female preponderance observed in this disease.","experiment, meta-analysis","","","","XCI skewage","","autoimmune thyroid diseases, graves' disease, hashimoto's thyroiditis","","human study","","","",""

L.","The number of human conditions that are currently considered to be autoimmune diseases (AID) has been steadily growing over the past decades and it is now estimated that over 10 million people are affected in the United States. One of the major shared features among AID is the predominance in the female sex which in some cases changes with the age at disease diagnosis. Numerous hypotheses have been formulated based on intuitive scientific backgrounds to justify this sex imbalance, i.e. sex hormones and reproductive factors, fetal microchimerism, other sex-related environmental factors, a skewing of the X-chromosome inactivation patterns, and major defects in sex chromosomes. Nevertheless, none of these hypotheses has thus far gathered enough convincing evidence and in most cases data are conflicting, as well illustrated by the reports on fetal microchimerism in systemic sclerosis or primary biliary cirrhosis. The present article will critically discuss the main hypotheses (loss of mosaicism, reactivation, and haploinsufficiency) that have been proposed based on findings in female patients with specific AID along with two additional mechanisms (X-chromosome vulnerability and X-linked polyamine genes) that have been observed in AID models. Further, recent data have significantly shifted the paradigm of X chromosome inactivation by demonstrating that a large number of genes can variably escape silencing on one or both chromosomes. As a result we may hypothesize that more than one mechanism may contribute to the female susceptibility to tolerance breakdown while the possibility that unknown factors may indeed protect men from AID should not be overlooked.","review","","x","","x","loss of mosaicism, reactivation, haploinsufficiency, X-chromosome vulnerability, X-linked polyamine genes","autoimmune","","","","","","Might be good to separate papers based on male or female bias in disease"

Gender can impact many disease states, including autoimmune diseases, and the factors that affect the development of autoimmune diseases and the regulation of longevity may share common mechanistic pathways. Other factors that may play a role include telomere and telomerase related differences, caloric restriction and changes in mitochondrial DNA.

Nevertheless, other organ specific autoimmune diseases (i.e. ulcerative colitis) are seemingly characterized with similar prevalence in both males and females. The reason for gender differences in certain autoimmune diseases remains unknown, but may be attributed to sex hormone influence, fetal microchimerism, X chromosome inactivation, and X chromosome abnormalities.

They have been widely explored in the context of viral infection and autoimmune disease where they play key roles in protection against infection or shaping disease pathogenesis. A false dichotomy has emerged in the study of IFN-I where interferons are thought of as either beneficial or pathogenic. This 'good or bad' viewpoint excludes more nuanced interpretations of IFN-I biology - for example, it is known that IFN-I is associated with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, yet is also protective in the context of infectious diseases and contributes to resistance to viral infection. Studies have suggested that a shared transcriptomic signature underpins both potential resistance to viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmune disease. This seems to be particularly evident in females, who exhibit increased viral resistance and increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease. The molecular mechanisms behind such a signature and the role of sex in its determination have yet to be precisely defined. From a genomic perspective, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFN-I pathway have been associated with both infectious and autoimmune disease. While overlap between infection and autoimmunity has been described in the incidence of these SNPs, it has been overlooked in work and discussion to date. Here, we discuss the possible contributions of IFN-Is to the pathogenesis of infectious and autoimmune diseases. We comment on genetic associations between common SNPs in IFN-I or their signalling molecules that point towards roles in protection against viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmunity and propose that a shared transcriptomic and genomic immunological signature may underlie resistance to viral infection and susceptibility to autoimmunity in humans.

In humans, sexual dimorphism in the immune response has been well demonstrated, with females exhibiting lower infection rates than males for a variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. There is also a substantially increased incidence of autoimmune disease in females compared to males. Together, these trends indicate that females have a heightened immune reactogenicity to both self and non-self-molecular patterns. However, the molecular mechanisms driving the sexually dimorphic immune response are not fully understood. The female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, as well as the male androgens, such as testosterone, elicit direct effects on the function and inflammatory capacity of immune cells. Several studies have identified a sex-specific transcriptome and methylome, independent of the well-described phenomenon of X-chromosome inactivation, suggesting that sexual dimorphism also occurs at the epigenetic level. Moreover, distinct alterations to the transcriptome and epigenetic landscape occur in synchrony with periods of hormonal change, such as puberty, pregnancy, menopause, and exogenous hormone therapy. These changes are also mirrored by changes in immune cell function. This review will outline the evidence for sex hormones and pregnancy-associated hormones as drivers of epigenetic change, and how this may contribute to the sexual dimorphism. Determining the effects of sex hormones on innate immune function is important for understanding sexually dimorphic autoimmune diseases, sex-specific responses to pathogens and vaccines, and how innate immunity is altered during periods of hormonal change (endogenous or exogenous).","review","","x","","","sex hormones","autoimmune","x","","","","",""

Results: Expressed in monocytes and B cells, CXorf21 basal Mrna, and protein expression levels are elevated in female primary monocytes, B cells, and EBV-transformed B cells compared to male cells. We also found CXorf21 mRNA and protein expression is higher in both male and female cells from SLE patients compared to control subjects. TLR7 ligation increased CXorf21 protein expression and CXorf21 knockdown abrogated TLR7-driven increased IFNA1 mRNA expression, and reduced secretion of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 in healthy female monocytes. Similarly, we found increased pH in the lysosomes of CXorf21-deficient female monocytes. Conclusion: CXorf21 is more highly expressed in female compared to male cells and is involved in a sexually dimorphic response to TLR7 activation. In addition, CXorf21 expression regulates lysosomal pH in a sexually dimorphic manner. Thus, sexually dimorphic expression of CXorf21 skews cellular immune responses in manner consistent with expected properties of a mediator of the X chromosome dose risk in SLE and pSS.","experiment","CXORF21, TLR7","","","","gene/protein function","systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), autoimmune, sjögren's syndrome (pss)","-","Western blot protein analysis, qPCR, BioPlex cytokine immunoassay, pHrodo™ assays, CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown","","","",""

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) release IFN-α upon TLR7 and TLR9 ligation. With respect to the nine times higher incidence of SLE in women and the clinical use of synthetic TLR ligands as novel immune adjuvants, we analyzed IFN-α and TNF-α production in healthy human individuals. Blood samples were incubated with synthetic TLR7 and TLR9 ligands. In three independent groups (n1 = 120, n2 = 101, and n3 = 123), analysis revealed a capacity of female PBLs to produce significantly higher IFN-α levels after TLR7 stimulation (p1, < 0.0000001, p2 < 0.0000001, and p3 < 0.0001) compared with male PBLs. In contrast, no sex differences were evident after TLR9 stimulation. TNF-α production after TLR7 stimulation and also total pDC numbers were not different between females and males. X-inactivation escape of the TLR7 gene was investigated in monoclonal B cell lines and, independently, in pDCs after cell sorting and single-cell picking, indicating regular silencing of one TLR7 allele in females. Additionally, exogenous 17β-estrogen and estrogen receptor antagonism did not indicate a significant role on TLR7-induced IFN-α production. Our data reveal for the first time a profound sex-dependent pathway of TLR7-induced IFN-α with higher production in females. These findings may explain the higher prevalence of SLE in females and the reported decreased therapeutic efficacy of synthetic TLR7 ligands in male individuals.

Design: Case-control study. Participants: Four hundred sixty-eight Taiwan-Chinese patients with GD; 200 of these patients had GO, whereas 268 patients did not. Methods: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the HLA-A and HLA-C loci were genotyped. Main Outcome Measures: The Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test with Bonferroni correction were used. The odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by applying unconditional logistic regression with a 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Strong gender effects on the distribution of the SNPs were apparent: male GD patients carrying an A allele at rs2074503 in the PRR3 gene tended to avoid demonstrating GO (P = 0.008; OR, 0.450; 95% CI, 0.248-0.819), whereas female patients tended to show GO (P = 0.01; OR, 1.486; 95% CI, 1.098-2.012). In addition, only the female GD patients with a T allele at rs1264439 in the ABCF-1 gene tended to demonstrate GO (P = 0.005; OR, 1.539; 95% CI, 1.139-2.081). Analysis of the haplotype blocks of the SNPs rs2074505 (GNL1) and rs2074503 (PRR3) showed that haplotype HA1 was underrepresented in male GO patients (P = 0.004; OR, 0.418; 95% CI, 0.228-0.767), whereas HA-4 was underrepresented in female GO patients (P = 0.007; OR, 0.660; 95% CI, 0.490-0.895).

J. and Livingston, D. H.","Females have a longer lifespan and better general health than males. Considerable number of studies also demonstrated that, after trauma and sepsis, females present better outcomes as compared to males indicating sex-related differences in the innate immune response. The current notion is that differences in the immuno-modulatory effects of sex hormones are the underlying causative mechanism. However, the field remains controversial and the exclusive role of sex hormones has been challenged. Here, we propose that polymorphic X-linked immune competent genes, which are abundant in the population are important players in sex-based immuno-modulation and play a key role in causing sex-related outcome differences following trauma or sepsis. We describe the differences in X chromosome (ChrX) regulation between males and females and its consequences in the context of common X-linked polymorphisms at the individual as well as population level. We also discuss the potential pathophysiological and immune-modulatory aspects of ChrX cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females and how this may contribute to sex-biased immune-modulation. The potential confounding effects of ChrX skewing of cell progenitors at the bone marrow is also presented together with aspects of acute trauma-induced de novo ChrX skewing at the periphery. In support of the hypothesis, novel observations indicating ChrX skewing in a female trauma cohort as well as case studies depicting the temporal relationship between trauma-induced cellular skewing and the clinical course are also described. Finally, we list and discuss a selected set of polymorphic X-linked genes, which are frequent in the population and have key regulatory or metabolic functions in the innate immune response and, therefore, are primary candidates for mediating sex-biased immune responses. We conclude that sex-related differences in a variety of disease processes including the innate inflammatory response to injury and infection may be related to the abundance of X-linked polymorphic immune-competent genes, differences in ChrX regulation, and inheritance patterns between the sexes and the presence of X-linked cellular mosaicism, which is unique to females.","experiment","Xist","","","","X chromosome mosaicism","autoimmune ","","","","","","relevant. could give genes of interest for autimmune disease"

Loss of immunological tolerance to self-antigens is a common feature of autoimmune disorders. Response to X-linked self-antigens could be influenced by X-chromosome inactivation, and contribute to the gender bias observed in autoimmune disorders. Previous studies have indicated an association between skewed X inactivation and autoimmune thyroid disease and scleroderma. To investigate a potential role of X inactivation in MS, we compared the X-inactivation pattern in 568 female MS patients with controls. We found no difference in degree of skewing between patients (median 64%) and controls (median 65%) (P = 0.474). The X-inactivation pattern did thus not explain the female predominance of MS patients in general. As the aetiology of different subgroups of MS may differ, patients were grouped according to disease course: relapsing-remitting (RR-MS), secondary progressive (SP-MS) and primary progressive (PP-MS). A comparison of the X-inactivation pattern between subgroups indicated a possible difference in degree of skewing between patients with a progressive versus a relapsing course (P = 0.05).","experiment","","","","","XCI","multiple sclerosis (ms), autoimmune","","","","","x",""

Despite a growing number of studies on sex bias in rheumatic diseases, sex-specific health care is¬†limited and sex specificity is not systematically integrated into treatment regimens. Women and men differ in three major biological points: the number of X chromosomes per cell, the type and quantities of sex hormones present and the ability to be pregnant, all of which have immunological consequences. Could a greater understanding of these differences lead to a new era of personalized sex-specific medicine? This Review focuses on the main genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that have been put forward to explain sex bias in rheumatic diseases, including X chromosome inactivation, sex chromosome aneuploidy and microchimerism. The influence of sex hormones is not discussed in detail in this Review, as it has been well described elsewhere.

Definitions and classifications of autoimmune diseases differ, as do the F/M ratios themselves. The sex ratio of lupus is the single most prominent, little explored clinical fact that may lead to understanding of how lupus and other autoimmune diseases occur. The objective of this study was to evaluate evidence for causes of high F/M ratios of autoimmune and non-immunologic diseases. This was done by a literature review. Some thyroid, rheumatic and hepatic diseases consistently have high F/M ratios; other autoimmune diseases have low ratios. Because F/M ratios reflect disease incidence, not disease severity, an intrinsic biologic cause for the F/M ratios (such as estrogen) would be likely to act through a threshold or permissive mechanism rather than through quantitative immunomodulation. Sex differences related to environmental exposure, X-inactivation, imprinting, X or Y chromosome genes and intrauterine influences are other possible explanations for sex differences of incidence. The epidemiology of the sex discrepant autoimmune diseases, young, female, suggests that an explanation for sex discrepancy lies in differential exposure, vulnerable periods or thresholds, rather than in quantitative aspects of immunomodulation.","review","","","","","hormones, estrogen, environmental exposure","lupus, autoimmune","","","","","","The epidemiology of the sex discrepant autoimmune diseases, young, female, suggests that an explanation for sex discrepancy lies in differential exposure, vulnerable periods or thresholds, rather than in quantitative aspects of immunomodulation."

Female/male ratios range from 10:1 to 1:3. In humans, severity of illness does not differ between men and women. Men and women respond similarly to infection and vaccination, which suggests that the intrinsic differences in immune response between the sexes do not account for differences in disease frequency. In autoimmune-like illnesses caused by recognized environmental agents, sex discrepancy is usually explained by differences in exposure. Because the beginnings of autoimmune diseases can be identified decades before clinical illness, a causative factor also would have to be sought decades before illness. Endogenous hormones are not a likely explanation for sex discrepancy; hormones could have an effect if the effect is a threshold rather than quantitative. X and Y chromosomal differences have not been studied in depth. Other possibilities to explain sex discrepancy include chronobiologic differences and various other biologies, such as pregnancy and menstruation, in which men differ from women. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The cause and mechanisms of this sex bias remains unknown despite multiple proposed hypotheses. Indeed, it is well established in several experimental settings that the human immune system exhibits sexual dimorphism with basic immune responses differing between females and males. Among candidate factors to explain these differences we note that particular attention has been primarily devoted to sex hormones, yet data have been inconclusive or have not been confirmed. The same seems to apply to the hypothesis of fetal microchimerism. Most recently, sex chromosome abnormalities and skewed X chromosome inactivation have been suggested as novel players, particularly in later-onset diseases.

It is generally believed that the female advantage is associated with the effects of sex hormones. This review argues that the sex benefit of females during the host response is associated with polymorphism of X-linked genes and cellular mosaicism for X-linked parental alleles. Cells from females carry both parental X chromosomes (maternal, Xm; or paternal, Xp), whereas males carry only one (Xm). Because of dosage compensation and random X inactivation, half of the cells from females express either Xm or Xp. Therefore, females are cellular mosaics for their X-linked polymorphic genes. This cellular mosaicism in females represents a more adaptive and balanced cellular machinery that is advantageous during the innate immune response. Several genes encoding key metabolic and regulatory proteins reside on the X chromosome, including members of the apoptotic cascade, hormone homeostasis, glucose metabolic enzymes, superoxide-producing machinery, and the toll-like receptor/nuclear factor Œ∫B/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway. Polymorphic forms of these X-linked proteins are likely to manifest in phenotypic differences in the mosaic cell populations in females and may contribute to sex-related differences in the host response to injury and infection. The unique inheritance pattern of X-linked polymorphisms and their potential confounding effects in clinical trials are also discussed; furthermore, we present potential biomarkers for studying mosaic cell populations of innate immunity. ¬©2007The Shock Society.","review","Xist ","mosaicism","","","mosaicism","autoimmune","","","","","",""

In this review, we describe the advantages and limitations of genetic methodologies, and how these methods have been used to discover candidate genes in smaller populations of pediatric patients. We also introduce novel concepts for nontraditional modes of genetic inheritance that may be important in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Recent findings Candidate genes identified by linkage analyses and genome-wide association scans in adult populations have led to focused genetic studies in pediatric populations. Some genes are associated with subsets of both adult and pediatric patients; others appear to be age specific. Novel concepts in genetics have uncovered potential contributions of maternal compared with paternal transmission, noninherited maternal alleles that may work through maternal microchimerism, and sex-specific epigenetic mechanisms of immunoregulation. Summary Advancing methods are leading to the discovery of genes associated with childhood autoimmune diseases. However, the genetic contribution to disease risk for any one gene remains less than 30% for most diseases, suggesting that pediatric autoimmunity is not primarily genetic in a classical sense. A combinatorial approach considering the contributions of multiple genes, mode of inheritance, and environmental influences will be required to fully understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis in pediatric autoimmune disease.","review","","","","","genetic methodologies","autoimmune","","genetic methodologies","age","","",""

A. and Scofield, R. H.","Background:CXorf21 and SLC15a4 both contain risk alleles for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS). The former escapes X inactivation. Our group predicts specific endolysosomal-dependent immune responses are driven by the protein products of these genes, which form a complex at the endolysosomal surface. Our previous studies have shown that knocking out CXorf21 increases lysosomal pH in female monocytes, and the present study assesses whether the lysosomal pH in 46,XX women, who overexpress CXorf21 in monocytes, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs), differs from 46,XY men. Methods: To determine endolysosome compartment pH we used both LysoSensor‚Ñ¢ Yellow/Blue DND-160 and pHrodo¬Æ Red AM Intracellular pH Indicator in primary monocyte, B cells, DCs, NK cells, and T cells from healthy men and women volunteers. Results: Compared to male samples, female monocytes, B cells, and DCs had lower endolysosomal pH (female/male pH value: monocytes 4.9/5.6 p < 0.0001; DCs 4.9/5.7 p = 0.044; B cells 5.0/5.6 p < 0.05). Interestingly, T cells and NK cells, which both express low levels of CXorf21, showed no differential pH levels between men and women. Conclusion: We have previously shown that subjects with two or more X-chromosomes have increased CXorf21 expression in specific primary immune cells. Moreover, knockdown of CXorf21 increases lysosomal pH in female monocytes. The present data show that female monocytes, DC, B cells, where CXorf21 is robustly expressed, have lower lysosomal pH compared to the same immune cell populations from males. The lower pH levels observed in specific female immune cells provide a function to these SLE/SS-associated genes and a mechanism for the reported inflated endolysosomal-dependent immune response observed in women compared to men (i.e., TLR7/type I Interferon activity).","experiment","CXorf21, SLC15a4","","","","lysosomal pH","systemic lupus erythematosus","","monocyte, B cells, DCs, NK cells, and T cells from healthy men and women","","","",""
