B.","Sex is a key risk factor for many types of cardiovascular disease. It is imperative to understand the mechanisms underlying sex differences to devise optimal preventive and therapeutic approaches for all individuals. Both biological sex (determined by sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones) and gender (social and cultural behaviors associated with femininity or masculinity) influence differences between men and women in disease susceptibility and pathology. Here, we focus on the application of experimental mouse models that elucidate the influence of 2 components of biological sex - sex chromosome complement (XX or XY) and gonad type (ovaries or testes). These models have revealed that in addition to well-known effects of gonadal hormones, sex chromosome complement influences cardiovascular risk factors, such as plasma cholesterol levels and adiposity, as well as the development of atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension. One mechanism by which sex chromosome dosage influences cardiometabolic traits is through sex-biased expression of X chromosome genes that escape X inactivation. These include chromatin-modifying enzymes that regulate gene expression throughout the genome. The identification of factors that determine sex-biased gene expression and cardiometabolic traits will expand our mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular disease processes and provide insight into sex differences that remain throughout the lifespan as gonadal hormone levels alter with age.`","experiment","","chromatin-modifying enzymes","","x","EXCI","cardiovascular, cardiac, adiposity, atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension","x","","","","","very relevant"

The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) is involved in X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female placental mammals, a process that ensures the balanced expression dosage of X-linked genes between sexes. XIST is abnormally expressed in many sex-biased diseases. In addition, escape from XIST-mediated XCI and skewed XCI also contribute to sex-biased diseases. Therefore, its expression or modification can be regarded as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of many sex-biased diseases. Genetic manipulation of XIST expression can inhibit the progression of some of these diseases in animal models, and therefore XIST has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target. In this manuscript, we summarize the current knowledge about the mechanisms for XIST-mediated XCI and the roles of XIST in sex-biased diseases, and discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting XIST.","review","Xist","","","","XCI, Xist regulation","autoimmune, neurological, pulmonary hypertension, cancer","","","","","","very relevant, exactly what we want to write"

S.","BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis is a sexually dimorphic disease, with women often presenting with sustained fibrosis and men with more extensive calcification. However, the intracellular molecular mechanisms that drive these clinically important sex differences remain underexplored. METHODS: Hydrogel biomaterials were designed to recapitulate key aspects of the valve tissue microenvironment and to serve as a culture platform for sex-specific valvular interstitial cells (VICs; precursors to profibrotic myofibroblasts). The hydrogel culture system was used to interrogate intracellular pathways involved in sex-dependent VIC-to-myofibroblast activation and deactivation. RNA sequencing was used to define pathways involved in driving sex-dependent activation. Interventions with small molecule inhibitors and siRNA transfections were performed to provide mechanistic insight into sex-specific cellular responses to microenvironmental cues, including matrix stiffness and exogenously delivered biochemical factors. RESULTS: In both healthy porcine and human aortic valves, female leaflets had higher baseline activation of the myofibroblast marker Œ±-smooth muscle actin compared with male leaflets. When isolated and cultured, female porcine and human VICs had higher levels of basal Œ±-smooth muscle actin stress fibers that further increased in response to the hydrogel matrix stiffness, both of which were higher than in male VICs. A transcriptomic analysis of male and female porcine VICs revealed Rho-associated protein kinase signaling as a potential driver of this sex-dependent myofibroblast activation. Furthermore, we found that genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation such as BMX and STS (encoding for Bmx nonreceptor tyrosine kinase and steroid sulfatase, respectively) partially regulate the elevated female myofibroblast activation through Rho-associated protein kinase signaling. This finding was confirmed by treating male and female VICs with endothelin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, factors that are secreted by endothelial cells and known to drive myofibroblast activation through Rho-associated protein kinase signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Together, in vivo and in vitro results confirm sex dependencies in myofibroblast activation pathways and implicate genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation in regulating sex differences in myofibroblast activation and subsequent aortic valve stenosis progression. Our results underscore the importance of considering sex as a biological variable to understand the molecular mechanisms of aortic valve stenosis and to help guide sex-based precision therapies.","experiment","BMX, STS","","","","EXCI","cardiac, aortic valve stenosis ","","RNA sequencing","","","","relevant"

Gender difference regarding prevalence and incidence of the most important age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, Type 2 diabetes, disability, autoimmunity and infections, are reviewed and updated with particular attention to the role of the immune system and immunosenescence. On the whole, gender differences appear to be pervasive and still poorly considered and investigated despite their biomedical relevance. The basic biological mechanisms responsible for gender differences in aging and longevity are quite complex and still poorly understood. The present review focuses on centenarians and their offspring as a model of healthy aging and summarizes available knowledge on three basic biological phenomena, i.e. age-related X chromosome inactivation skewing, gut microbiome changes and maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA genetic variants. In conclusion, an appropriate gender-specific medicine approach is urgently needed and should be systematically pursued in studies on healthy aging, longevity and age-related diseases, in a globalized world characterized by great gender differences which have a high impact on health and diseases.","review","","","","","XCI","cardiovascular, neurological, cancer, type 2 diabetes, disability, autoimmune, infection","","","","","","relevant"
"5",74,"Sex-linked genetic mechanisms and atrial fibrillation risk",2022,"Eur J Med Genet","Wren, G. and Davies, W.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac condition characterised by an irregular heartbeat, atrial pathology and an elevated downstream risk of thrombosis and heart failure, as well as neurological sequelae including stroke and dementia. The prevalence and presentation of, risk factors for, and therapeutic responses to, AF differ by sex, and this sex bias may be partially explained in terms of genetics. Here, we consider four sex-linked genetic mechanisms that may influence sex-biased phenotypes related to AF and provide examples of each: X-linked gene dosage, X-linked genomic imprinting, sex-biased autosomal gene expression, and male-limited Y-linked gene expression. We highlight novel candidate risk genes and pathways that warrant further investigation in clinical and preclinical studies. Understanding the biological basis of sex differences in AF should allow better prediction of disease risk, identification of novel risk/protective factors, and the development of more effective sex-tailored interventions.","","x","x","","x","imprinting, male-limited Y-linked gene expression","atrial fibrillation, cardiac, stroke, dementia","imprinting","","","","","might give example mechanisms that we can use "

J. and Peters, D. K. and Anseth, K. S. and Aguado, B. A.","Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a sexually dimorphic cardiovascular disease that is driven by fibrosis and calcification of the aortic valve leaflets. Circulating inflammatory factors present in serum from AVS patients contribute to sex differences in valve fibro-calcification by driving the activation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) to myofibroblasts and/or osteoblast-like cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory factors contribute to sex-specific valve fibro-calcification remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified inflammatory factors present in serum samples from AVS patients that regulate sex-specific myofibroblast activation and osteoblast-like differentiation. After correlating serum proteomic datasets with clinical and in vitro myofibroblast datasets, we identified annexin A2 and cystatin C as candidate inflammatory factors that correlate with both AVS patient severity and myofibroblast activation measurements in vitro. Validation experiments utilizing hydrogel biomaterials as cell culture platforms that mimic the valve extracellular matrix confirmed that annexin A2 and cystatin C promote sex-specific VIC activation to myofibroblasts via p38 MAPK signaling. Additionally, annexin A2 and cystatin C increase osteoblast-like differentiation primarily in male VICs. Our results implicate serum inflammatory factors as potential AVS biomarkers that also contribute to sexually dimorphic AVS progression by driving VIC myofibroblast activation and/or osteoblast-like differentiation. Collectively, the results herein further our overall understanding as to how biological sex may impact inflammation-driven AVS and may lead to the development of sex-specific drug treatment strategies.","experiment","p38 MAPK, annexin A2, cystatin C","x","","","","aortic valve stenosis (avs), cardiac","","","","x","",""
"7",335,"The Impact of Sex Chromosomes in the Sexual Dimorphism of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension",2022,"American Journal of Pathology","Predescu, D. N. and Mokhlesi, B. and Predescu, S. A.","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a sex-biased disease with a poorly understood female prevalence. Emerging research suggests that nonhormonal factors, such as the XX or XY sex chromosome complement and sex bias in gene expression, may also lead to sex-based differences in PAH incidence, penetrance, and progression. Typically, one of females' two X chromosomes is epigenetically silenced to offer a gender-balanced gene expression. Recent data demonstrate that the long noncoding RNA X-inactive specific transcript, essential for X chromosome inactivation and dosage compensation of X-linked gene expression, shows elevated levels in female PAH lung specimens compared with controls. This molecular event leads to incomplete inactivation of the females' second X chromosome, abnormal expression of X-linked gene(s) involved in PAH pathophysiology, and a pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) proliferative phenotype. Moreover, the pathogenic proliferative p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/ETS transcription factor ELK1 (Elk1)/cFos signaling is mechanistically linked to the sexually dimorphic proliferative response of PAECs in PAH. Apprehending the complicated relationship between long noncoding RNA X-inactive specific transcript and X-linked genes and how this relationship integrates into a sexually dimorphic proliferation of PAECs and PAH sex paradox remain challenging. We highlight herein new findings related to how the sex chromosome complement and sex-differentiated epigenetic mechanisms to control gene expression are decisive players in the sexual dimorphism of PAH. Pharmacologic interventions in the light of the newly elucidated mechanisms are discussed.","experiment","Xist, ELK1","XCI","","","pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) proliferation","pulmonary hypertension","","","","","","This molecular event leads to incomplete inactivation of the females' second X chromosome, abnormal expression of X-linked gene(s) involved in PAH pathophysiology, and a pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) proliferative phenotype."

G. and Chen, S. C. and Bouvagnet, P.","We studied a series of 42 cases of transposition of the great arteries (TGA), a complex heart defect (CHD) that is two times more prevalent in males than in females. A mutation in the X chromosome at the ZIC3 gene was found in two affected siblings (one male, one female) and their unaffected mother. A second factor, skewed X-inactivation pattern explained the discrepancy between the daughter/mother phenotype. In this family, the missense mutation (p.W255G) was found in the first zinc finger of ZIC3, a domain that is relatively specific to each of the five human ZIC genes. It was tested further along with two other mutations of this domain (p.C253S and p.H286R). In transfected 3T3 cells, mutants p.W255G and p.H286R expressed lower protein levels, and an increased protein degradation (p.W255G only). Moreover, mutants p.C253S and p.W255G had a decreased transcription activation of the TK-luciferase reporter gene. Nuclear translocation of the three ZIC3 mutants varied considerably depending on the experimental models. Finally, p.W255G and p.H286R showed diminished activities for both left-right axis disturbance and neural crest induction in Xenopus embryos. These results suggest that mutations in the first zinc finger of ZIC3 mildly affect several functions of the protein.","experiment","ZIC3","","","x","skewed XCI","cardiac","","","","","",""

Although recent studies have evaluated the differences in the clinical features and prognosis between the two sexes, many issues remain to be elucidated. At present, the only sex-specific condition that affects females is peripartum cardiomyopathy. Recent evidence suggests a pathogenetic role of a prolactin derivative, and ongoing clinical trials are investigating the possibility of targeted therapies using prolactin secretion inhibitors, such as bromocriptine and carbegoline. Although women were considered so far only carriers of X-linked diseases (Anderson-Fabry disease, Danon disease, Hunter syndrome and dystrophinopathies), clinical experience showed a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in females due to random X chromosome inactivation. Conversely, in mitochondrial diseases (with matrilineal inheritance), cardiomyopathies may occur in the context of clinical multisystemic involvement without significant gender-related differences. Autosomal inherited cardiomyopathies also show different phenotypes and prognostic impact according to gender. The hypothesis of a premenopausal protective role of female hormones towards myocardial involvement has been raised by recent data on transtiretin-related amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Preexisting cardiomyopathies may affect pregnancy, labor and delivery in women, since all these conditions are associated with important hemodynamic changes. Women with low-risk hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (asymptomatic and without left ventricular outflow tract gradient) usually can tolerate pregnancy. Conversely, women who are symptomatic before pregnancy or have severe hypertrophy with important outflow tract gradient are at higher risk and should be referred to a tertiary center to be evaluated on a case by case basis. Pregnancy in women with dilated cardiomyopathy and significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction represents a high-risk condition. In addition, information on the clinical course and potential complications in pregnant women with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy or restrictive cardiomyopathy is limited to individual reports. ¬© 2012 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore.","review","","","","","mosaicism","cardiomyopathy","","","","x","",""
