Despite a growing number of studies on sex bias in rheumatic diseases, sex-specific health care isÂ limited and sex specificity is not systematically integrated into treatment regimens. Women and men differ in three major biological points: the number of X chromosomes per cell, the type and quantities of sex hormones present and the ability to be pregnant, all of which have immunological consequences. Could a greater understanding of these differences lead to a new era of personalized sex-specific medicine? This Review focuses on the main genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that have been put forward to explain sex bias in rheumatic diseases, including X chromosome inactivation, sex chromosome aneuploidy and microchimerism. The influence of sex hormones is not discussed in detail in this Review, as it has been well described elsewhere. Understanding the sex-specific factors that contribute to the initiation and progression of rheumatic diseases will enable progress to be made in the diagnosis, treatment and management of all patients with these conditions.","L2003484855 2019-11-04 2019-11-07","10.1038/s41584-019-0307-6","microRNA;aneuploidy;autosomal disorder;copy number variation;epigenetics;gene;gene locus;gene silencing;genome-wide association study;heredity;human;microchimerism;nonhuman;pathophysiology;pregnancy;priority journal;review;rheumatic disease;sex chromosome;sex difference;X chromosome inactivation;X linked gene;Y chromosome;Rheumatic Diseases;Bias (Epidemiology)",NA,NA

In order to spot previously unknown miR expression differences we took advantage of prior knowledge on specialized databases to identify X chromosome-encoded miRs potentially escaping X chromosome inactivation (XCI). MiR-548am-5p emerged as potentially XCI escaper and was experimentally verified to be significantly up-regulated in human XX primary dermal fibroblasts (DFs) compared to XY ones. Accordingly, miR-548am-5p target mRNAs, e.g. the transcript for Bax, was differently modulated in XX and XY DFs. Functional analyses indicated that XY DFs were more prone to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis than XX ones. Experimentally induced overexpression of miR548am-5p in XY cells by lentivirus vector transduction decreased apoptosis susceptibility, whereas its down-regulation in XX cells enhanced apoptosis susceptibility. These data indicate that this approach could be used to identify previously unreported sex-biased differences in miR expression and that a miR identified with this approach, miR548am-5p, can account for sex-dependent differences observed in the susceptibility to mitochondrial apoptosis of human DFs.","2041-4889 Matarrese, Paola Tieri, Paolo Orcid: 0000-0002-3635-7664 Anticoli, Simona Ascione, Barbara Conte, Maria Franceschi, Claudio Malorni, Walter Orcid: 0000-0002-1223-7000 Salvioli, Stefano Ruggieri, Anna Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2019/09/13 Cell Death Dis. 2019 Sep 11;10(9):673. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1888-3.","10.1038/s41419-019-1888-3","Adult;Apoptosis/*genetics;Cells, Cultured;Chromosomes, Human, X/*metabolism;Databases, Genetic;Down-Regulation/genetics;Female;Fibroblasts/*metabolism;Genes, X-Linked;Humans;Male;MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism;Mitochondria/*genetics/metabolism;Sex Characteristics;Up-Regulation/genetics;X Chromosome;Mitochondria",NA,NA

The X chromosome plays an important role in human disease and traits of many species, especially those with sexually dimorphic characteristics. Special attention needs to be given to its analysis due to the unique inheritance pattern, which leads to analytical complications that have resulted in the majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) either not considering X or mishandling it with toolsets that had been designed for non-sex chromosomes. We hence developed XWAS to fill the need for tools that are specially designed for analysis of X. Following extensive, stringent, and X-specific quality control, XWAS offers an array of statistical tests of association, including: 1) the standard test between a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and disease risk, including after first stratifying individuals by sex, 2) a test for a differential effect of a SNP on disease between males and females, 3) motivated by X-inactivation, a test for higher variance of a trait in heterozygous females as compared with homozygous females, and 4) for all tests, a version that allows for combining evidence from all SNPs across a gene. We applied the toolset analysis pipeline to 16 GWAS datasets of immune-related disorders and 7 risk factors of coronary artery disease, and discovered several new X-linked genetic associations. XWAS will provide the tools and incentive for others to incorporate the X chromosome into GWAS and similar studies in any species with an XX/XY system, hence enabling discoveries of novel loci implicated in many diseases and in their sexual dimorphism.","L606039763 2015-09-22 2015-09-28","10.1093/jhered/esv059","article;autoimmune disease;bioinformatics;coronary artery disease;data analysis software;effect size;female;genetic analysis;genetic association;genetic marker;genetic risk;heterozygote;homozygote;human;male;priority journal;quality control procedures;quantitative genetics;risk assessment;sex difference;single nucleotide polymorphism;systolic blood pressure;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X chromosome linked disorder;X Chromosome;Software",NA,NA

Testing for association on the X chromosome raises unique challenges that have motivated the development of X-specific statistical tests in the literature. However, to date there has been no study of these methods under a wide range of realistic study designs, allele frequencies and disease models to assess the size and power of each test. To address this, we have performed an extensive simulation study to investigate the effects of the sex ratios in the case and control cohorts, as well as the allele frequencies, on the size and power of eight test statistics under three different disease models that each account for X-inactivation. We show that existing, but under-used, methods that make use of both male and female data are uniformly more powerful than popular methods that make use of only female data. In particular, we show that Clayton's one degree of freedom statistic [Clayton, 2008] is robust and powerful across a wide range of realistic simulation parameters.

The sex ratio of lupus is the single most prominent, little explored clinical fact that may lead to understanding of how lupus and other autoimmune diseases occur. The objective of this study was to evaluate evidence for causes of high F/M ratios of autoimmune and non-immunologic diseases. This was done by a literature review. Some thyroid, rheumatic and hepatic diseases consistently have high F/M ratios; other autoimmune diseases have low ratios. Because F/M ratios reflect disease incidence, not disease severity, an intrinsic biologic cause for the F/M ratios (such as estrogen) would be likely to act through a threshold or permissive mechanism rather than through quantitative immunomodulation. Sex differences related to environmental exposure, X-inactivation, imprinting, X or Y chromosome genes and intrauterine influences are other possible explanations for sex differences of incidence. The epidemiology of the sex discrepant autoimmune diseases, young, female, suggests that an explanation for sex discrepancy lies in differential exposure, vulnerable periods or thresholds, rather than in quantitative aspects of immunomodulation.","L35244428 2002-11-12","10.1191/0961203302lu274oa","estrogen;autoimmune disease;behavior;conference paper;environmental exposure;environmental factor;genome imprinting;human;immunomodulation;incidence;liver disease;priority journal;rheumatic disease;sex difference;sex ratio;thyroid disease;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;Sex Ratio;Rheumatic Diseases",NA,NA

The effect of CSF2 on gene expression was modified by sex (P < 0.05) for five genes (DDX3Y/DDX3X-like, NANOG, MYF6, POU5F1 and RIPK3) and tended (P < 0.10) to be modified by sex for five other genes (DAPK1, HOXA5, PPP2R3A, PTEN and TNFSF8). In experiment 2, embryos were treated at Day 5 with control or CSF2 and blastocysts were collected at Day 7 for immunolabeling to determine the number of inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) cells.

SLE incidence in female is substantially higher than males, but males tend to have more severe manifestations including greater risk of lupus nephritis (LN). Aberrant genetic expression of immune cells plays a vital role in pathogenesis of SLE and may explain gender diapariesties. We conducted bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SLE females and males with and without LN to identify gene differences and possible sex-tailored treatment. The gene expression profiling datasets (GSE 99967) were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo and analyzed by GEO2R platform. GSE 99967 used ffymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array and mRNA from whole blood. The t-test was done and adjusted P-value < 0.03 by Benjamini & Hochberg method was a threshold for statistically significant DEGs. 15 and 13 DEGs were obtained comparing SLE females with SLE males without and with LN, respectively. 13 common genes identified in both comparisons. XIST was the only down-regulated gene in male, located at X chromosome and responsible for initiation and spread of X-inactivation. X inactivation provides XIST dosage equivalence between genders. This suggested altered X-chromosome inactivation lead to female bias in SLE. Of 12 common up-regulated genes in male, 10 located at Y chromosome and showed a decrease up-regulated in SLE males with LN compare to without. A markly DEGs drop was found in TXLNGY, UTY and USP9Y, located at Yq 11.22. TXLNGY is a pseudo-gene so may not have roles in sex bias. UTY is a male-specific histone demethylase and USP9Y regulates level of protein turnover by preventing protein degradation including TGF-beta signaling. Change in UTY and USP9Y expression may associate with developing LN and drugs modifying their expression might benefit in treatment or prevention of LN in SLE males. The study enhanced an understanding of SLE sexual bias. Aberrant XIST inactivation may cause different incidence of SLE among gender. Drugs changing XIST expression might cure SLE.

Focusing on Levene's test to detect phenotypic variance differences associated with the genotype groups of an X-chromosome SNP, we first note that sex can be an inherent confounder; sex necessarily correlates with the number of minor allele of the SNP, and it could also correlate, through both mean and variance, with the distribution of quantitative traits that exhibit sexual dimorphism, such as height and BMI.

Endogenous hormones are not a likely explanation for sex discrepancy; hormones could have an effect if the effect is a threshold rather than quantitative. X and Y chromosomal differences have not been studied in depth. Other possibilities to explain sex discrepancy include chronobiologic differences and various other biologies, such as pregnancy and menstruation, in which men differ from women.

Many explanations have been proposed, including sex hormones, the X chromosome, microchimerism, environmental factors, and the microbiome. However, the mechanism for this autoimmune sex bias remains obscure. In this manuscript, we evaluate the hypothesis that qualitative or quantitative differences in circulating antibodies may explain, at least in part, the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and its sex bias-especially when considering an evolutionary perspective. Indeed, women have higher absolute levels of antibodies than men, and (auto)antibodies are also associated with most autoimmune diseases. Several facts suggest differences in antibodies may cause increased prevalence of autoimmune disease in women. First, the association between increased quantities of serum antibodies and increased prevalence of autoimmunity is found not only in women, but also in men with Klinefelter syndrome. Second, both serum antibody levels and autoimmunity spike in the postpartum period. Third, a dose-response effect exists between parity and both serum antibodies and prevalence of autoimmune disease. Fourth, many biologically plausible mechanisms explain the association, such as T cell-dependent activation of B cells and/or VGLL3. The evolutionary underpinning of increased antibodies in women is likely to be protection of offspring from infections. Overall, this evolutionary paradigm can help explain why the phenomenon of autoimmunity occurs preferentially in women and raises the possibility of new treatment options.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 8 Total Times Cited: 9 Cited Reference Count: 62","10.1111/eva.13167","autoantibody;autoimmune;evolution;gender;immunoglobulin;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;SEX-DIFFERENCES;KLINEFELTERS-SYNDROME;RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS;GENDER-DIFFERENCES;GUT MICROBIOME;CD40 LIGAND;EXPRESSION;RISK;AUTOANTIBODIES;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity",NA,NA

Yet, for decades, most basic and clinical studies have included only male individuals. As modern health care moves towards personalized medicine, it is clear that considering sex and hormonal status in basic and clinical studies will bring precision to the development of novel therapeutics and treatment paradigms. To this end, funding, regulatory and policy agencies now require inclusion of female animals and women in basic and clinical studies. However, inclusion of female animals and women often does not mean that information regarding potential hormonal interactions with pharmacological treatments or clinical outcomes is available. All sex steroid hormones can interact with receptors for drug targets, metabolism and transport. Genetic variation in receptors or in enzymatic function might contribute to sex differences in therapeutic efficacy and adverse drug reactions. Outcomes from clinical trials are often not reported by sex, and, if the data are available, they are not translated into clinical practice guidelines.

Environmental factors such as tobacco use and clinical management issues such as delayed presentation have widely been associated with sex differences in UCB outcomes. Emerging findings from immune checkpoint blockade trials are suggestive of differential outcomes in females compared with males. Sex-specific differences in the way immune system functions and responds to pathogenic insults are well established. As such, an in-depth understanding of the genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to sex-associated differences in response to immunomodulatory therapies is needed urgently for improved management of UCB. Objective: To review the associations between patient sex and clinical outcomes, with a focus on the incidence, host intrinsic features, and response to therapies in UCB. Evidence acquisition: Using the PubMed database, this narrative review evaluates published findings from mouse model-based and clinical cohort studies to identify factors associated with sex and clinical outcomes in bladder cancer. A scoping review of the key findings on epidemiology, genetic, hormonal, immune physiology, and clinical outcomes was performed to explore potential factors that could have implications in immunomodulatory therapy design. Evidence synthesis: Sex-associated differences in UCB incidence and clinical outcomes are influenced by sex hormones, local bladder resident immune populations, tumor genetics, and bladder microbiome. In the context of therapeutic outcomes, sex differences are prominent in response to bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin immunotherapy used in the treatment of nonâmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. Similarly, with respect to tumor molecular profiles in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, tumors from females show enrichment of the basal subtype. Conclusions: Among proposed tumor/host intrinsic factors that may influence response to immune-based therapies, patient sex remains a challenging consideration that deserves further attention. Evidence to date supports a multifactorial origin of sexual dimorphism in the incidence and outcomes of UCB. Patient summary: In this review, we highlight the sex-associated host and tumor intrinsic features that may potentially drive differential disease progression and therapeutic response in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Sexual dimorphism in bladder cancer incidence and clinical outcomes is well established. Significant differences in sex-associated physiological immune responses play critical roles in response to conventional and novel immunotherapy for bladder cancer.","L2007885093 2020-09-25","10.1016/j.euo.2020.08.013","androgen;androgen receptor;estrogen receptor alpha;sex hormone;steroid 5alpha reductase inhibitor;tamoxifen;adaptive immunity;bladder cancer;bladder microbiome;cancer genetics;cancer immunotherapy;cancer incidence;cancer survival;cancer therapy;clinical outcome;environmental factor;gene expression regulation;gene mutation;human;immune response;immunobiology;immunomodulation;innate immunity;intrinsic activity;microflora;nonhuman;priority journal;protein function;review;sex difference;survival rate;transitional cell carcinoma;treatment outcome;treatment response;X chromosome inactivation;Urinary Bladder Neoplasms;Sex Characteristics",NA,NA

At the onset of XCI, Xist RNA accumulates on one of two Xs, coating and silencing the chromosome in cis. The molecular basis for monoallelic Xist upregulation is not known, though evidence predominantly supports a posttranscriptional mechanism through RNA stabilization. Here, we test whether Tsix RNA destabilizes Xist RNA. Unexpectedly, we find that Xist upregulation is not based on transcript stabilization at all but is instead controlled by transcription in a sex-specific manner. Tsix directly regulates its transcription. On the future inactive X, Tsix downregulation induces a transient heterochromatic state in Xist, followed paradoxically by high-level Xist expression. A Tsix-deficient X chromosome adopts the heterochromatic state in pre-XCI cells. This state persists through XCI establishment and ""reverts"" to a euchromatic state during XCI maintenance. We have therefore identified chromatin marks that preempt and predict asymmetric Xist expression.

The buffering effect of heterozygosity in females will be partly constrained by the skewing of X-inactivation patterns increasing the variance of females beyond what is expected. Furthermore, escape of some X-linked genes from in-activation may also be relevant to male-female variance comparisons. We also comment on the difficulty of establishing the extent to which the X chromosome is enriched for intelligence genes and point out that their estimates of the proportion of genes influencing general intelligence that might be located on the X chromosome rely on some doubtful premises, especially concerning the likely equivalence of X-linked gene action in males and females.

It is generally believed that the female advantage is associated with the effects of sex hormones. This review argues that the sex benefit of females during the host response is associated with polymorphism of X-linked genes and cellular mosaicism for X-linked parental alleles. Cells from females carry both parental X chromosomes (maternal, Xm; or paternal, Xp), whereas males carry only one (Xm). Because of dosage compensation and random X inactivation, half of the cells from females express either Xm or Xp. Therefore, females are cellular mosaics for their X-linked polymorphic genes. This cellular mosaicism in females represents a more adaptive and balanced cellular machinery that is advantageous during the innate immune response. Several genes encoding key metabolic and regulatory proteins reside on the X chromosome, including members of the apoptotic cascade, hormone homeostasis, glucose metabolic enzymes, superoxide-producing machinery, and the toll-like receptor/nuclear factor ÎºB/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway. Polymorphic forms of these X-linked proteins are likely to manifest in phenotypic differences in the mosaic cell populations in females and may contribute to sex-related differences in the host response to injury and infection. The unique inheritance pattern of X-linked polymorphisms and their potential confounding effects in clinical trials are also discussed; furthermore, we present potential biomarkers for studying mosaic cell populations of innate immunity.

The most striking clinical feature is an inflammatory nevus that usually shows a unique lateralization with strict midline demarcation. Ipsilateral defects involve all skeletal structures and internal organs such as the brain, the lung, the heart, or the kidney. As an exception to this rule, in some cases the CHILD nevus may occur in a more or less bilateral distribution. In 1997 Fink-Puches et al described a case of CHILD nevus with an almost symmetric arrangement. To test the correctness of the diagnosis, we now examined blood lymphocytes of this patient by single-strand conformation analysis and genomic sequencing. We identified a novel missense mutation in NSDHL that potentially may impair protein function. We conclude that a diagnosis of CHILD syndrome can be based on clinical features such as the highly characteristic morphology of the CHILD nevus. A symmetric distribution of this nevus can exceptionally be seen in patients with CHILD syndrome, and this bilateral involvement should not mislead the clinician to any other diagnosis.

Several proposed models require the presence of specific sequences near genes to permit the spread of inactivation into these regions. If such models are correct, one might predict that heterologous genes transferred onto the X chromosome might lack the appropriate signal sequences and therefore escape inactivation. To determine whether a foreign gene inserted into the X chromosome is subject to inactivation, transgenic mice harboring 11 copies of the complete, 17-kilobase chicken transferrin gene on the X chromosome were used. Male mice hemizygous for this insert were bred with females bearing Searle's translocation, an X-chromosome rearrangement that is always active in heterozygous females (the unrearranged X chromosome is inactive). Female offspring bearing the Searle's translocation and the chicken transferrin gene had the same amount of chicken transferrin messenger RNA in liver as did transgenic male mice or transgenic female mice lacking the Searle's chromosome. This result shows that the inserted gene is not subject to X-chromosome inactivation and suggests that the inactivation process cannot spread over 187 kilobases of DNA in the absence of specific signal sequences required for inactivation.","L17069930 1987-07-07","","animal cell;animal experiment;blood and hemopoietic system;chicken;genetic engineering;heredity;in vitro study;mouse;nonhuman;priority journal;sex difference;transferrin gene;X chromosome inactivation;Chickens;Transferrin;X Chromosome;Mice",NA,NA

In this review, we describe the advantages and limitations of genetic methodologies, and how these methods have been used to discover candidate genes in smaller populations of pediatric patients. We also introduce novel concepts for nontraditional modes of genetic inheritance that may be important in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Recent findings Candidate genes identified by linkage analyses and genome-wide association scans in adult populations have led to focused genetic studies in pediatric populations. Some genes are associated with subsets of both adult and pediatric patients; others appear to be age specific. Novel concepts in genetics have uncovered potential contributions of maternal compared with paternal transmission, noninherited maternal alleles that may work through maternal microchimerism, and sex-specific epigenetic mechanisms of immunoregulation. Summary Advancing methods are leading to the discovery of genes associated with childhood autoimmune diseases. However, the genetic contribution to disease risk for any one gene remains less than 30% for most diseases, suggesting that pediatric autoimmunity is not primarily genetic in a classical sense. A combinatorial approach considering the contributions of multiple genes, mode of inheritance, and environmental influences will be required to fully understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis in pediatric autoimmune disease.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 2 Total Times Cited: 2 Cited Reference Count: 59","10.1097/BOR.0b013e328307f283","autoimmune;genetics;juvenile dermatomyositis;Kawasaki disease;pediatric;systemic lupus erythematosus;SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS;NONINHERITED MATERNAL ANTIGENS;RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS;FUNCTIONAL POLYMORPHISM;KAWASAKI-DISEASE;X-INACTIVATION;HLA ALLELES;ASSOCIATION;ONSET;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity",NA,NA

Polyamine depletion in primary trophoblasts reduced glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation resulting in decreased acetyl-coA availability and global histone hypoacetylation in a sex-dependent manner. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-sequencing identifies progesterone biosynthesis as a target of polyamine regulated gene expression, and polyamine depletion reduced progesterone release in male trophoblasts. The effects of polyamine depletion can be attributed to spermine as SMS-silencing recapitulated the effects on energy metabolism, histone acetylation, and progesterone release.

Emerging research suggests that nonhormonal factors, such as the XX or XY sex chromosome complement and sex bias in gene expression, may also lead to sex-based differences in PAH incidence, penetrance, and progression. Typically, one of females' two X chromosomes is epigenetically silenced to offer a gender-balanced gene expression. Recent data demonstrate that the long noncoding RNA X-inactive specific transcript, essential for X chromosome inactivation and dosage compensation of X-linked gene expression, shows elevated levels in female PAH lung specimens compared with controls. This molecular event leads to incomplete inactivation of the females' second X chromosome, abnormal expression of X-linked gene(s) involved in PAH pathophysiology, and a pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) proliferative phenotype. Moreover, the pathogenic proliferative p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/ETS transcription factor ELK1 (Elk1)/cFos signaling is mechanistically linked to the sexually dimorphic proliferative response of PAECs in PAH. Apprehending the complicated relationship between long noncoding RNA X-inactive specific transcript and X-linked genes and how this relationship integrates into a sexually dimorphic proliferation of PAECs and PAH sex paradox remain challenging. We highlight herein new findings related to how the sex chromosome complement and sex-differentiated epigenetic mechanisms to control gene expression are decisive players in the sexual dimorphism of PAH.

Our group predicts specific endolysosomal-dependent immune responses are driven by the protein products of these genes, which form a complex at the endolysosomal surface. Our previous studies have shown that knocking out CXorf21 increases lysosomal pH in female monocytes, and the present study assesses whether the lysosomal pH in 46,XX women, who overexpress CXorf21 in monocytes, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs), differs from 46,XY men. Methods: To determine endolysosome compartment pH we used both LysoSensorâ¢ Yellow/Blue DND-160 and pHrodoÂ® Red AM Intracellular pH Indicator in primary monocyte, B cells, DCs, NK cells, and T cells from healthy men and women volunteers. Results: Compared to male samples, female monocytes, B cells, and DCs had lower endolysosomal pH (female/male pH value: monocytes 4.9/5.6 p < 0.0001; DCs 4.9/5.7 p = 0.044; B cells 5.0/5.6 p < 0.05). Interestingly, T cells and NK cells, which both express low levels of CXorf21, showed no differential pH levels between men and women. Conclusion: We have previously shown that subjects with two or more X-chromosomes have increased CXorf21 expression in specific primary immune cells. Moreover, knockdown of CXorf21 increases lysosomal pH in female monocytes. The present data show that female monocytes, DC, B cells, where CXorf21 is robustly expressed, have lower lysosomal pH compared to the same immune cell populations from males. The lower pH levels observed in specific female immune cells provide a function to these SLE/SS-associated genes and a mechanism for the reported inflated endolysosomal-dependent immune response observed in women compared to men (i.e., TLR7/type I Interferon activity).","1664-3224 Harris, Valerie M Harley, Isaac T W Kurien, Biji T Koelsch, Kristi A Scofield, Robert Hal U54 GM104938/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States U19 AI082714/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States P30 AR053483/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States P30 AR073750/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States T32 AR007534/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States I01 BX001451/BX/BLRD VA/United States R01 AR053734/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

In contrast, most male DDX3X variants are inherited from an unaffected mother, with one documented exception being a recently identified de novo splice site variant.

The resulting genotypes are XX and XY- females (ovary-bearing) along with XXSry and XY(-)Sry males (testes-bearing). Here we report results of basic behavioral phenotyping conducted with these mice. Motor coordination, use of olfactory cues to find a food item, general activity, foot shock threshold, and behavior in an elevated plus maze were not affected by gonadal sex or sex chromosome complement. In a one-way active avoidance learning task females were faster to escape an electric shock than males. In addition, sex chromosome complement differences were noted during social interactions with submissive intruders. Female XY- mice were faster to follow an intruder than XX female mice. All XY- mice spent more time sniffing and grooming the intruder than the XX mice, with XY- females spending the most amount of time in this activity. Finally, XX females were faster to display an asocial behavior, digging, and engaged in more digging than XXSry male mice. All of these behaviors were tested in gonadectomized adults, thus, differences in circulating levels of gonadal steroids cannot account for these effects.

It was tested further along with two other mutations of this domain (p.C253S and p.H286R). In transfected 3T3 cells, mutants p.W255G and p.H286R expressed lower protein levels, and an increased protein degradation (p.W255G only). Moreover, mutants p.C253S and p.W255G had a decreased transcription activation of the TK-luciferase reporter gene. Nuclear translocation of the three ZIC3 mutants varied considerably depending on the experimental models.

During preimplantation development, male and female embryos can display phenotypic differences that can only be attributed to the transcriptional differences resulting from their different sex chromosome complements. Thus, all expressed Y-linked genes and those X-linked genes that totally or partially escape X-chromosome inactivation at each specific developmental stage display transcriptional sexual dimorphism. Furthermore, these differentially expressed sex chromosome transcripts can regulate the transcription of autosomal genes, leading to a large transcriptional sexual dimorphism. The sex-dependent transcriptional differences may affect several molecular pathways such as glucose metabolism, DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation, and protein metabolism. These molecular differences may have developmental consequences, including sex-selective embryo loss and sex-specific epigenetic responses to environmental hazards, leading to long-term effects.

It has long been assumed that a large proportion of recurrent spontaneous abortion results from genetic problems, but no causative genes have been identified to date. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a subset of women with recurrent spontaneous abortion are carriers of X-linked recessive disorders that result in the loss of male pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: X chromosome inactivation patterns, an assay used to detect women who are likely to be carriers of X-linked recessive cell-lethal traits, were compared between 105 female patients with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss and 101 women (control subjects) with a single successful pregnancy and no history of pregnancy loss. Inheritance patterns and gender of offspring were studied in relevant subsets of participants. RESULTS: Female patients showed a highly statistically significant increase in the frequency of skewed X chromosome inactivation (90%; P < .0005). Female patients with highly skewed X chromosome inactivation showed a significant decrease in male children. Four of 6 families that were studied showed maternal inheritance of the skewed inactivation trait. CONCLUSION: We found the 14% of women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss show highly skewed X inactivation, which suggests that they are carriers of X-linked recessive lethal traits. Furthermore, the observed gender bias among women with highly skewed X inactivation suggests selective loss of male conceptions, which is consistent with an X chromosome-linked genetic defect that leads to cell death or growth disadvantage. Identification of such female carriers is important for the reproductive counseling and treatment of these women.","Lanasa, M C Hogge, W A Kubik, C J Ness, R B Harger, J Nagel, T Prosen, T Markovic, N Hoffman, E P NICHD38126/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

The objectives of this work were to confirm that unusual inheritance and to investigate non-Mendelian genetic effects that may influence differences in Brahman Ã Simmental crossbred calves. Crossbred calves were produced by embryo transfer ( = 2,862) and natural service or artificial insemination ( = 2,125) from 1983 to 1991 by a private seedstock producer. Brahman-sired F embryos out of Simmental donors weighed 9.4 Â± 1.1 ( < 0.001) kg more at birth than Simmental-sired F embryos out of Brahman donor cows when transferred to comparable recipients. This reciprocal difference was accompanied by sexual dimorphism: within Brahman-sired F calves, males were 5.0 Â± 1.4 kg heavier than females, whereas within Simmental-sired F calves, females were 0.7 Â± 0.5 kg heavier than males. Covariates were constructed from the pedigree to represent genetic effects: proportion Brahman in calves and dams (direct and maternal breed effects), direct and maternal breed heterozygosity, probability of Brahman mitochondrial origin, probability of Brahman Y chromosome, probability of Brahman X chromosome, genomic imprinting (the difference between the probabilities of Brahman in the genetic dam and in the sire), nonrandom X inactivation by breed of origin (the probability of breed heterozygosity of the X chromosomes of a female), and nonrandom X inactivation by parent of origin (the difference between probabilities of a female inheriting a paternal or maternal Brahman X chromosome).

Whilst ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is recognized as the main etiological factor, the relationship between exposure and host phenotype is still unclear. We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane databases for studies assessing the genetic basis of host response to UVR DNA damage, the effect of UVR on generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and their detoxification, UVR induced skin immunity modifications, and the role of genomic instability with a focus on the potential use of these biomarkers to the surgical treatment planning and prognosis of BCC patients. Data suggest that risk for BCC development is likely to result from the combined effect of many genes, each with a relatively weak individual contribution. Certain genomic alterations have been associated with increased or reduced risk for BCC development, with a second primary BCC or with recurrence of BCC. However, use of these biomarkers in everyday practice should be supported by further studies, mainly for its cost-effectiveness. In addition, not enough information exists on the prognostic value of existing demographic and clinical risk predictors for BCC regarding development of second primary or recurrent tumors. Information reviewed suggests that these predictors are of higher predictive value compared with biomarkers whilst they are indisputably cheaper and easier to monitor even in developing countries. Conclusively, we suggest that further studies aimed in investigating second primary or recurrent BCC are needed to provide better information on the predictive value of certain demographic, clinical and histological factors.

Failure to analyze X-chromosome data at all is obviously less than ideal, and can lead to missed discoveries. Even when X-chromosome data are included, they are often analyzed with suboptimal statistics. Several mathematically sensible statistics for X-chromosome association have been proposed. The optimality of these statistics, however, is based on very specific simple genetic models. In addition, while previous simulation studies of these statistics have been informative, they have focused on single-marker tests and have not considered the types of error that occur even under the null hypothesis when the entire X chromosome is scanned. In this study, we comprehensively tested several X-chromosome association statistics using simulation studies that include the entire chromosome. We also considered a wide range of trait models for sex differences and phenotypic effects of X inactivation. We found that models that do not incorporate a sex effect can have large type I error in some cases. We also found that many of the best statistics perform well even when there are modest deviations, such as trait variance differences between the sexes or small sex differences in allele frequencies, from assumptions.","L623822557 2018-09-13","10.1002/gepi.22132","article;female;gene frequency;genetic model;genome-wide association study;male;null hypothesis;sex difference;simulation;statistics;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome",NA,NA

This phenomenon is due to a finite period during preimplantation development when both X chromosomes are active, between embryonic genome activation and X chromosome inactivation, around the blastocyst stage. Consequently, prior to implantation male and female embryos exhibit differences in their cellular phenotype. Manifestations of such differences include altered total activity of specific X-linked enzymes and the metabolic pathways they regulate. Subsequently, one would expect to be able to determine differences in the rate of consumption and utilization of specific nutrients between male and female embryos. Data to date on animal models support this, with sex-specific differences in glucose and amino acid utilization being reported for the mouse and cow blastocysts. Such differences in metabolic phenotype may logically be involved in the reported differences in growth rates between preimplantation embryos of different sex. As the fields of proteomics and metabolomics are being increasingly applied to human assisted con-ception it is prudent to consider how such technologies may be applied to identify sex differences in the human embryo. Such data would have implications far beyond current invasive technologies used to identify the sex of an embryo conceived in vitro for the diagnosis of X-linked diseases. Â© The Author 2010.

There is an unexplained, strong male preponderance of individuals with the ATMDS phenotype with a >5:1 male-female ratio and furthermore, all the somatic ATRX mutations described to date have been in males.

These mechanisms include upregulation of the heterogametic chromosome as well as repression in the homogametic sex. Remarkably, strategies for dosage compensation differ between species. In organisms where more is known about molecular mechanisms of dosage compensation, specific protein complexes containing noncoding RNAs are targeted to the X chromosome. In addition, the dosage-regulated chromosome often occupies a specific nuclear compartment. Some genes escape dosage compensation, potentially resulting in sex-specific differences in gene expression. This review focuses on dosage compensation in mammals, with comparisons to fruit flies, nematodes, and birds.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 138 Total Times Cited: 141 Cited Reference Count: 176","10.1146/annurev-genet-110711-155454","dosage compensation;X upregulation;X inactivation;epigenetics;evolution;sex chromosomes;X-LINKED GENES;FEMALE-BIASED EXPRESSION;COPY NUMBER VARIATION;Sex Chromosomes",NA,NA

Previous studies have identified epigenetic differences between sexes in some human tissues. However, it is unclear whether epigenetic modifications contribute to sex-specific differences in insulin secretion and metabolism. Here, we investigate the impact of sex on the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in human pancreatic islets from 53 males and 34 females, and relate the methylome to changes in expression and insulin secretion. RESULTS: Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is higher in female versus male islets. Genome-wide DNA methylation data in human islets clusters based on sex. While the chromosome-wide DNA methylation level on the X-chromosome is higher in female versus male islets, the autosomes do not display a global methylation difference between sexes. Methylation of 8,140 individual X-chromosome sites and 470 autosomal sites shows sex-specific differences in human islets. These include sites in/near AR, DUSP9, HNF4A, BCL11A and CDKN2B. 61 X-chromosome genes and 18 autosomal genes display sex-specific differences in both DNA methylation and expression. These include NKAP, SPESP1 and APLN, which exhibited lower expression in females. Functional analyses demonstrate that methylation of NKAP and SPESP1 promoters in vitro suppresses their transcriptional activity. Silencing of Nkap or Apln in clonal beta-cells results in increased insulin secretion. Differential methylation between sexes is associated with altered levels of microRNAs miR-660 and miR-532 and related target genes. CONCLUSIONS: Chromosome-wide and gene-specific sex differences in DNA methylation associate with altered expression and insulin secretion in human islets. Our data demonstrate that epigenetics contribute to sex-specific metabolic phenotypes.","L609795135 2016-04-18","10.1186/s13059-014-0522-z","insulin;microRNA;MIRN532 microRNA, human;MIRN660 microRNA, human;aged;CpG island;DNA methylation;female;gene expression;genetic epigenesis;genetics;human;human genome;male;metabolism;middle aged;molecular genetics;pancreas islet;secretion (process);sexual development;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Sex Characteristics;Islets of Langerhans;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Gene Expression;Methylation;Genomics",NA,NA

However, the intracellular molecular mechanisms that drive these clinically important sex differences remain underexplored. METHODS: Hydrogel biomaterials were designed to recapitulate key aspects of the valve tissue microenvironment and to serve as a culture platform for sex-specific valvular interstitial cells (VICs; precursors to profibrotic myofibroblasts). The hydrogel culture system was used to interrogate intracellular pathways involved in sex-dependent VIC-to-myofibroblast activation and deactivation. RNA sequencing was used to define pathways involved in driving sex-dependent activation. Interventions with small molecule inhibitors and siRNA transfections were performed to provide mechanistic insight into sex-specific cellular responses to microenvironmental cues, including matrix stiffness and exogenously delivered biochemical factors. RESULTS: In both healthy porcine and human aortic valves, female leaflets had higher baseline activation of the myofibroblast marker Î±-smooth muscle actin compared with male leaflets. When isolated and cultured, female porcine and human VICs had higher levels of basal Î±-smooth muscle actin stress fibers that further increased in response to the hydrogel matrix stiffness, both of which were higher than in male VICs. A transcriptomic analysis of male and female porcine VICs revealed Rho-associated protein kinase signaling as a potential driver of this sex-dependent myofibroblast activation. Furthermore, we found that genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation such as BMX and STS (encoding for Bmx nonreceptor tyrosine kinase and steroid sulfatase, respectively) partially regulate the elevated female myofibroblast activation through Rho-associated protein kinase signaling. This finding was confirmed by treating male and female VICs with endothelin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, factors that are secreted by endothelial cells and known to drive myofibroblast activation through Rho-associated protein kinase signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Together, in vivo and in vitro results confirm sex dependencies in myofibroblast activation pathways and implicate genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation in regulating sex differences in myofibroblast activation and subsequent aortic valve stenosis progression. Our results underscore the importance of considering sex as a biological variable to understand the molecular mechanisms of aortic valve stenosis and to help guide sex-based precision therapies.","L637034332 2022-02-01 2022-03-07","10.1161/circulationaha.121.054108","actin;biological marker;transcriptome;animal;aortic valve;aortic valve stenosis;cell culture;cytology;disease model;drug effect;female;gene expression;gene expression regulation;genetics;human;immunohistochemistry;male;metabolism;myofibroblast;pathology;pig;sex factor;signal transduction;X chromosomal inheritance;X chromosome inactivation;Sex Characteristics;X Chromosome",NA,NA

Biochemical evidence based on increasing hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) activity during the mouse morula stage indicates that at least one X chromosome is functional. This is corroborated by the observation that mouse embryos lacking an X chromosome do not survive beyond the early cleavage stages. The principal approach to determining whether both X chromosomes are functional before inactivation has been to look at the distributions of the activities of known X-linked enzymes in individual embryos. A bimodal distribution would be expected if dosage compensation had not yet occurred and female embryos with two X chromosomes made twice as much enzyme as male embryos with only one. However, identities of the embryos being assayed are not known, and conclusions based on activity distributions are necessarily inferential. We have circumvented this difficulty by using a method which facilitates determination of the sex of the embryonic material being assayed. This has led to the demonstration that early male and female mouse blastocysts differ twofold in HGPRT activity, a finding indicative of uncompensated X-chromosome dosage dependent gene activity before X-chromosome inactivation.","L8396817 1978-12-11","","animal experiment;blastocyst;gene activity;heredity;histology;in vitro study;mouse;sex difference;X chromatin;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome",NA,NA

Such alterations might also be involved in the sex-related growth differences in preimplantation embryos found in some animal species. In the present study we analysed cell numbers of human male and female surplus embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage after either IVF or ICSI in order to investigate possible sex-dependent differential growth rates. Methods: Blastocysts resulting from surplus embryos obtained after either IVF or ICSI during a 5 year study period were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: The number of cells and sex could be determined in 330 blastocysts collected from 92 IVF cycles and in 322 blastocysts collected from 121 ICSI cycles. Whereas female and male embryos originating from IVF showed comparable mean log cell numbers per embryo Â± SEM (3.76 Â± 0.05 in 147 female and 3.72 Â± 0.04 in 183 male embryos), significant differences were observed in embryos originating from ICSI (3.57 Â± 0.05 in 162 female and 3.90 Â± 0.03 in 160 male embryos). The sex-related growth difference was significantly greater in ICSI than in IVF embryos. In a subset of 84 embryos, inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) were analysed separately.

Whereas male-to-female ratios of expression of autosomal genes were distributed around a mean of 1, X chromosome genes were clearly shifted towards higher expression in females.

The PCH generates a series of expectations that can be tested empirically and that may help to identify the mechanisms underlying sex differences in modern human diseases.","Natri, Heini Garcia, Angela R Buetow, Kenneth H Trumble, Benjamin C Wilson, Melissa A R35 GM124827/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States RF1 AG054442/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review England 2019/06/16 Trends Genet. 2019 Jul;35(7):478-488. doi: 10.1016/j.tig.2019.04.008.","10.1016/j.tig.2019.04.008","Animals;Autoimmune Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology;Evolution, Molecular;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Hormones/*physiology;Humans;Male;Mammals;Neoplasms/epidemiology;Pregnancy/*immunology;Sex Characteristics;*Sex Chromosomes;*Sex Factors;Urban Population;X inactivation;autoimmunity;cancer;dosage compensation;placentation;pregnancy compensation hypothesis;sex differences;Humanities;Humanism;Pregnancy",NA,NA

In particular, very recent studies have unraveled striking differences between cells carrying XX or XY chromosomes in terms of response to stressful stimuli, indicating the presence of genetic and epigenetic differences determining sex-specific metabolic or phenotypic traits. Although this field of investigation is still in its infancy, available data suggest a key role of sexual chromosomes in determining cell life or death. In particular, cells carrying XX chromosomes exhibit a higher adaptive potential and survival behavior in response to microenvironmental variations with respect to XY cells. Cells from females also appear to be equipped with more efficient epigenetic machinery than the male counterpart. In particular, the X chromosome contains an unexpected high number of microRNAs (miRs), at present 118, in comparison with only two miRs localized on chromosome Y, and an average of 40-50 on the autosomes. The regulatory power of these small non-coding RNAs is well recognized, as 30-50% of all protein-coding genes are targeted by miRs and their role in cell fate has been well demonstrated. In addition, several further insights, including DNA methylation patterns that are different in males and females, claim for a significant gender disparity in cancer and in the immune system activity against tumors. In this brief paper, we analyze the state of the art of our knowledge on the implication of miRs encoded on sex chromosomes, and their related functional paths, in the regulation of cell homeostasis and depict possible perspectives for the epigenetic research in the field.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 54 Total Times Cited: 54 Cited Reference Count: 88","10.1038/s41418-017-0051-x","x-chromosome inactivation;cell-death;tumor progression;DNA methylation;immune-response;gene-expression",NA,NA

SLE is one of many autoimmune disorders that have a strong gender bias, with 70-90% of SLE patients being female. Several explanations have been postulated to account for the severity of autoimmune diseases in females, including hormonal, microbiota, and gene dosage differences. X-linked toll-like receptors (TLRs) have recently been implicated in disease progression in females. Our previous studies using the 564Igi mouse model of SLE on a Tlr7 and Tlr9 double knockout background showed that the presence of Tlr8 on both X chromosomes was required for the production of IgG autoantibodies, Ifn-I expression and granulopoiesis in females. Here, we show the results of our investigation into the role of Tlr8 expression in SLE pathogenesis in 564Igi females. Female mice have an increase in serum pathogenic anti-RNA IgG2a and IgG2b autoantibodies. 564Igi mice have also been shown to have an increase in neutrophils in vivo, which are major contributors to Ifn-Î± expression. Here, we show that neutrophils from C57BL/6 mice express Ifn-Î± in response to 564 immune complexes and TLR8 activation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from 564Igi females have a significant increase in Tlr8 expression compared to male-derived cells, and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization data suggest that Tlr8 may escape X-inactivation in female-derived macrophages.

Together, these findings suggest p53 directly activates XIC genes, without which there is stochastic failure in X chromosome inactivation, and that X chromosome inactivation failure may underlie the female bias in neural tube closure defects.","10.1016/j.celrep.2019.03.048","BIM protein;histone H3;nuclear protein;protein p53;RNA;X linked inhibitor of apoptosis;animal cell;animal experiment;animal model;animal tissue;apoptosis;article;Bim gene;binding affinity;binding site;chromosome inactivation;controlled study;DNA responsive element;embryo;female;gene;gene expression;gene expression profiling;gene frequency;gene knockout;gene loss;genetic association;histone methylation;Huwe1 gene;male;mouse;neural tube;neural tube defect;nonhuman;priority journal;protein depletion;protein function;RNA sequence;sex difference;survival rate;survival time;tumor suppressor gene;upregulation;Usp9x gene;X chromosome;XIAP gene;XIC gene;Xist gene;X Chromosome;Neural Tube Defects",NA,NA

DNA was genotyped using 2.5 HumanOmni Beadchip from Illumina. Statistical analyses were performed in PLINK 1.9, MACH 1.0 and Minimac2. The variant rs12007907 (g.29483892C>A) in IL1RAPL gene was suggestively associated with asthma symptoms in discovery set (odds ratio (OR)=0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37-0.67; P=3.33 Ã 10 - 6). This result was replicated in the ProAr cohort in men only (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.21-0.95; P=0.038). Furthermore, investigating the functional role of the rs12007907 on the production a Th2-type cytokine, IL-13, we found a negative association between the minor allele A with IL-13 production in the discovery set (P=0.044). Gene-based analysis revealed that NUDT10 was the most consistently associated with asthma symptoms in discovery sample. In conclusion, the rs12007907 variant in IL1RAPL gene was negatively associated with asthma and IL-13 production in our study and a sex-specific association was observed in one of the validation samples.

Recent observations have highlighted a critical role of XIAP for the regulation of NOD2 signaling and are probably the molecular basis for increasingly recognized further immune dysregulatory symptoms of XIAP deficient patients, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We describe a large Caucasian family in which IBD and erythema nodosum (EN) also manifested in female carriers of XIAP mutations. METHODS: Clinical data and laboratory findings including flow cytometric analysis of XIAP protein expression and sequencing of the BIRC4 gene. NOD2 signaling was investigated by determination of TNFÎ± production in monocytes upon L18-MDP stimulation in vitro. RESULTS: The BIRC4 nonsense mutation p.P225SfsX226 was identified as the genetic cause of XIAP deficiency in our family. Surprisingly, clinical symptoms were not restricted to male patients, but also occurred in several female carriers. The most severely affected carrier demonstrated random X-inactivation, leading to a significant expression of mutated XIAP protein in monocytes, and consequently to impaired NOD2 responses in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our report provides further evidence that clinical symptoms of XIAP deficiency are not restricted to male patients. Random X-inactivation may be associated with EN and mild IBD also in female carriers of BIRC4 mutations. Analysis of the X-inactivation pattern reflected by XIAP protein expression can identify such carriers and the analysis of NOD2 signaling by flow cytometry can confirm the functional significance. XIAP expression patterns should be investigated in female patients with a family history of EN and/or IBD.","1573-2592 Dziadzio, Magdalena Ammann, Sandra Canning, Claire Boyle, Fiona Hassan, Amel Cale, Cathy Elawad, Mamoun Fiil, Berthe Katrine Gyrd-Hansen, Mads Salzer, Ulrich Speckmann, Carsten Grimbacher, Bodo Case Reports Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Netherlands 2015/05/07 J Clin Immunol. 2015 Jul;35(5):439-44. doi: 10.1007/s10875-015-0166-0.

Studies performed in yeast, worms, flies and mice subjected to genetic and pharmacological interventions have given insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with longevity. Furthermore, it is now possible to effectively modulate pathways that slow aging at different stages of life (early life or at an adult age). Interestingly, interventions that extend longevity in adult miceÂ have had sex-specific success, suggesting a potential link between particular pathways that modulate aging and sex. For example, reduction of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis at an adult age extends lifespan preferentially in females. Moreover, several postnatalÂ dietary interventions tested by the âIntervention Testing Program (ITP)â from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) have shown that while pharmacological interventions like rapamycin affect the IGF-1/insulin pathway and preferentially extend lifespan in females; dietary compounds that target other cellular pathways are effective only in male miceâindicating mutually exclusive sex-specific pathways. Therefore, a combination of interventions that targetÂ non-overlapping aging-related pathways appears to be an effectiveÂ approach to further extend healthy lifespan in both sexes. Here, we review the germline and postnatal mouse lines that target the GH/IGF-1 axis as a mechanism to extend longevity as well as the dietary compounds that tested positive in the NIA program to increase lifespan. We believe that the interventions reviewed in this paper could constitute feasible combinations for an extended healthy lifespan in both male and female mice.","L2010194614 2021-02-09 2021-10-27","10.1007/s11102-020-01117-0","growth hormone;insulin;pregnancy associated plasma protein A;protein p53;somatomedin C;thyrotropin;aging;BALB cBy mouse;C57BL 6 mouse;CB6F1 mouse;diet composition;diet restriction;DNA repair;extend healthy lifespan;gene targeting;germline mutation;glucose metabolism;glucose tolerance;growth hormone release;homozygosity;hormone action;hormone metabolism;human;insulin sensitivity;intervention testing program;knockout mouse;lifespan;longevity;nonhuman;oxidative stress;perinatal period;program evaluation;review;risk factor;sex chromosome;sex difference;signal transduction;transgenic mouse;X chromosome inactivation;Growth Hormone",NA,NA

Mutations in the MECP2 gene were identified in approximately 70-80% of sporadic Rett syndrome cases. Methods - We have screened the MECP2 gene coding region for mutations in five familial cases of Rett syndrome and studied the patterns of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in each girl. Results - We found a mutation in MECP2 in only one family. In the four families without mutation in MECP2, we found that (1) all mothers exhibit a totally skewed pattern of XCI; (2) six out of eight affected girls also have a totally skewed pattern of XCI; and (3) it is the paternally inherited X chromosome which is active in the patients with a skewed pattern of XCI. Given that the skewing of XCI is inherited in our families, we genotyped the whole X chromosome using 32 polymorphic markers and we show that a locus potentially responsible for the skewed XCI in these families could be located on the short arm of the X chromosome. Conclusion - These data led us to propose a model for familial Rett syndrome transmission in which two traits are inherited, an X linked locus abnormally escaping X chromosome inactivation and the presence of a skewed XCI in carrier women.","L32661204 2001-08-05","10.1136/jmg.38.7.435","gene product;methyl CpG binding protein 2;unclassified drug;article;chromosome arm;controlled study;diagnostic value;female;gene locus;gene mutation;genetic screening;genotype;human;molecular model;priority journal;Rett syndrome;segregation analysis;sex difference;X chromosome inactivation;Rett Syndrome;X Chromosome;Mutation",NA,NA

However, if both X-chromosome linked color deficient males (â¼8%) and females (<1%) as well as heterozygote female carriers (â¼15%) are excluded from comparisons, then differences between men and women in red-green (RG) color discrimination have been reported as not being significant (e.g., Pickford, 1944; Hood et al., 2006). We re-examined this question by assessing the performance of 150 males and 150 females on the color assessment and diagnosis (CAD) test (Rodriguez-Carmona et al., 2005). This is a sensitive test that yields small color detection thresholds. The test employs direction-specific, moving, chromatic stimuli embedded in a background of random, dynamic, luminance contrast noise. A four-alternative, forced-choice procedure is employed to measure the subject's thresholds for detection of color signals in 16 directions in color space, while ensuring that the subject cannot make use of any residual luminance contrast signals. In addition, we measured the Rayleigh anomaloscope matches in a subgroup of 111 males and 114 females. All the age-matched males (30.8 Â± 9.7) and females (26.7 Â± 8.8) had normal color vision as diagnosed by a battery of conventional color vision tests. Females with known color deficient relatives were excluded from the study. Comparisons between the male and female groups revealed no significant differences in anomaloscope midpoints (p = 0.709), but a significant difference in matching ranges (p = 0.040); females on average tended to have a larger mean range (4.11) than males (3.75). Females also had significantly higher CAD thresholds than males along the RG (p = 0.0004), but not along the yellow-blue (YB) discrimination axis. The differences between males and females in RG discrimination may be related to the heterozygosity in X-linked cone photo pigment expression common among females.

XQTL adopts the framework of the orthogonal model implemented in the QTDT program, modifying the sex-specific score for X-linked genotypes. XQTL also takes into account the dosage effect due to female X chromosome inactivation. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) and Fisher's scoring method are used to estimate variance components of random effects. Fixed effects, derived from the phenotypic differences among and within families, are estimated by the least-squares method. Our proposed XQTL can perform allelic and two-locus haplotypic association tests and can provide estimates of additive genetic effects and variance components. Simulation studies show correct type I error rates under the null hypothesis and robust statistical power under alternative scenarios. The loss of power observed when parental genotypes are missing can be compensated by an increase of offspring number.

Areas covered This paper provides an overview on the role of chromosome X (chrX) in explaining why females have higher susceptibility to autoimmunity. The work outlines some essential concepts regarding chrX inactivation, escape from chrX inactivation and the evolutionary history of chrX. In addition, we will discuss the concept of gene escape in immune cells, with examples related to specific X-linked genes and autoimmune diseases. Expert opinion There is growing evidence that many genes present on chrX escape inactivation, and some of them have significant immune-mediated functions. In immune cells of female individuals the escape of these genes is not constant, but the knowledge of the mechanisms controlling this plasticity are not completely understood. Future studies aimed at the characterization of these modifications at single-cell resolution, together with conformational 3D studies of the inactive X chromosome, will hopefully help to fill this gap of knowledge.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 0 Total Times Cited: 0 Cited Reference Count: 100","10.1080/1744666x.2022.2060203","Autoimmune diseases;autoimmunity;escape from X-chromosome inactivation;mammalian evolution;sex bias;sex chromosomes;X-chromosome inactivation;CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;FEMALE PREDOMINANCE;SEX-DIFFERENCES;T-CELLS;DISEASE;GENDER;WOMEN;EPIDEMIOLOGY;MECHANISMS;MONOSOMY",NA,NA

The sex difference arises through the androgenic sparing of the motoneurons and their target muscles from ontogenetic cell death. Indirect evidence suggests that androgen acts on the target muscles rather than directly on SNB motoneurons to spare them from death. The testicular feminization mutation (Tfm), a defect in the androgen receptor (AR), blocks androgenic sparing of SNB motoneurons and their targets. The pattern of AR immunocytochemistry was previously found to be different in adult Tfm and wild-type rats: immunostaining was nuclear in most SNB cells of wild-type rats, but very few SNB cells display nuclear AR immunostaining in affected Tfm rats. Because the Tfm mutation is carried on the X chromosome, random X inactivation during development makes female carriers of Tfm (+/Ttm) genetic mosaics for androgen sensitivity. Tfm carriers, their wild-type sisters, and affected Tfm males were treated with perinatal testosterone and immunocytochemistry was used to detect androgen receptor in the SNB when the rats reached adulthood. Mosaic females could be distinguished from their wild-type sisters by external morphology. In such perinatally androgenized mosaics, adult SNB cells were equally divided between wild-type and Tfm genotype, as indicated by AR immunocytochemistry. In contrast, the pattern of AR immunocytochemistry in target muscles of mosaics appeared similar to that of wild-type females. These results indicate that early androgen spared both androgen-sensitive and -insensitive motoneurons from cell death, confirming a site of androgen action other than the motoneurons themselves.","L27148176 1997-05-11","10.1006/hbeh.1996.0047","androgen receptor;testosterone;animal experiment;apoptosis;article;controlled study;drug effect;female;lumbar spine;male;masculinization;motoneuron nucleus;mutant;nonhuman;phenotype;priority journal;rat;sex differentiation;subcutaneous drug administration;Apoptosis;Rats;Androgens;Virilism",NA,NA

Although recent studies have evaluated the differences in the clinical features and prognosis between the two sexes, many issues remain to be elucidated. At present, the only sex-specific condition that affects females is peripartum cardiomyopathy. Recent evidence suggests a pathogenetic role of a prolactin derivative, and ongoing clinical trials are investigating the possibility of targeted therapies using prolactin secretion inhibitors, such as bromocriptine and carbegoline. Although women were considered so far only carriers of X-linked diseases (Anderson-Fabry disease, Danon disease, Hunter syndrome and dystrophinopathies), clinical experience showed a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in females due to random X chromosome inactivation. Conversely, in mitochondrial diseases (with matrilineal inheritance), cardiomyopathies may occur in the context of clinical multisystemic involvement without significant gender-related differences. Autosomal inherited cardiomyopathies also show different phenotypes and prognostic impact according to gender. The hypothesis of a premenopausal protective role of female hormones towards myocardial involvement has been raised by recent data on transtiretin-related amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Preexisting cardiomyopathies may affect pregnancy, labor and delivery in women, since all these conditions are associated with important hemodynamic changes. Women with low-risk hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (asymptomatic and without left ventricular outflow tract gradient) usually can tolerate pregnancy. Conversely, women who are symptomatic before pregnancy or have severe hypertrophy with important outflow tract gradient are at higher risk and should be referred to a tertiary center to be evaluated on a case by case basis. Pregnancy in women with dilated cardiomyopathy and significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction represents a high-risk condition. In addition, information on the clinical course and potential complications in pregnant women with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy or restrictive cardiomyopathy is limited to individual reports.

Girls also exhibited significantly longer fever duration (2 days [1-6] vs. 1 day [1-3] for the boys, P<0.01), lower pH on admission (7.32 [7.25-7.39] vs. 7.37 [7.31-7.43] P = 0.03), and lower base excess (-6 mEq/L [-10.7 to -0.8] vs. -2.3 mEq/L [-6.6 to -2.6], P<0.01), as well as lower bicarbonate levels (19.1 mEq/l [15.9-24.0] vs. 21.15 mEq/l [18.3-26.68], P = 0.04), when compared with the boys. Conclusions: Our study revealed higher neutrophilic inflammation, as well as lower pH on admission, in girls with severe sepsis; associated with longer fever duration, which could contribute to better pathogen clearance. However, further studies are needed to demonstrate the link between acidosis and modulation of the immune response.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 5 Total Times Cited: 6 Cited Reference Count: 33","10.1097/shk.0000000000000773","Acidosis;gender difference;neutrophilic immune response;pediatric sepsis;GENDER-DIFFERENCES;CELLULAR MOSAICISM;X-INACTIVATION;HEALTH;EXPRESSION;MORTALITY;CYTOKINES;PROTEIN;Only Child;Child;Sex Characteristics;Acid-Base Equilibrium;Sepsis",NA,NA

This report describes the results from factor VIII gene (F8) analysis of a New Zealand cohort of 45 proband HA patients. We screened all proband HA patients attending local clinics to determine the molecular basis of disease in each case. We also aimed to evaluate the significance of founder effect in this population and to explain an unusual case of HA in a female patient. HA patients were screened for the common F8 gene inversion mutations using previously described PCR-based techniques, and for single base substitution mutations using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and DNA sequencing. Analysis of microsatellite markers located within or near F8 was used to determine identity by descent and trace inheritance patterns of disease alleles. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) patterns were detected using methylation specific PCR. Pathogenic F8 gene mutations were detected in all 45 HA patients in this cohort and non-random XCI was confirmed in a female haemophiliac. We report nine novel F8 mutations, including two splicing mutations, a five nucleotide deletion and a large deletion at the 5â² end of the gene. The molecular aetiology of HA was similar to that described in other studies but the distribution of mutations was unusual due to founder effects, with almost a quarter of all probands being descended from just three individuals.

A fascinating aspect of evolution is the differentiation of sex chromosomes. Organisms with highly differentiated sex chromosomes, such as the mammalian X and Y, must compensate for the imbalance in gene dosage that this creates. The need to adjust the expression of sex-linked genes is a potent force driving the rise of regulatory mechanisms that act on an entire chromosome. This review will contrast the process of dosage compensation in Drosophila with the divergent strategies adopted by other model organisms. While the machinery of sex chromosome compensation is different in each instance, all share the ability to direct chromatin modifications to an entire chromosome. This review will also explore the idea that chromosome-targeting systems are sometimes adapted for other purposes. This appears the likely source of a chromosome-wide targeting system displayed by the Drosophila fourth chromosome.","Larsson, Jan Meller, Victoria H Journal Article Review Netherlands 2006/07/06 Chromosome Res. 2006;14(4):417-31. doi: 10.1007/s10577-006-1064-3.","10.1007/s10577-006-1064-3","Animals;Chromosomes/genetics;Dosage Compensation, Genetic/*genetics;Drosophila/*genetics;Drosophila Proteins/genetics;Female;Gene Expression Regulation;Male;Recombination, Genetic/genetics;Sex Chromosomes/*genetics;Sex Factors;Transcription Factors;X Chromosome Inactivation/genetics;Sex Chromosomes",NA,NA

Xist is known to be controlled by the non-coding Xite and Tsix loci, but the mechanisms by which Tsix and Xite regulate Xist are yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we examine the role of higher order chromatin structure across the 100-kb region of the mouse X-inactivation center (Xic) and map domains of specialized chromatin in vivo. By hypersensitive site mapping and chromosome conformation capture (3C), we identify two domains of higher order chromatin structure. Xite makes looping interactions with Tsix, while Xist makes contacts with Jpx/Enox, another non-coding gene not previously implicated in XCI. These regions interact in a developmentally-specific and sex-specific manner that is consistent with a regulatory role in XCI. We propose that dynamic changes in three-dimensional architecture leads to formation of separate chromatin hubs in Tsix and Xist that together regulate the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation.

They are used as standard treatments for hypertension, congestive cardiac failure and diabetes. Angioedema is an adverse effect associated the use of ACEi which is significantly more common in Black and Coloured South Africans than in the Caucasian population. This serious adverse effect is frequently life-threatening and fatal. The use of ACEi such as enalapril precipitates severe anaphylactic reactions which are induced by activation of bradykinin, a vasodilatory and pro-inflammatory nonapeptide. Angioedema may only be associated with the use of enalapril and not other classes of ACEi such as perindopril or ramipril. The incidence of ACEi associated angioedema (AEi) as a life-threatening adverse effect has been associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C2399A in the XPNPEP2 gene which encodes membrane bound aminopeptidase (APP) enzyme [1]. The gene is located on the X chromosome. We performed a preliminary investigation to ascertain whether there is any association between AEi and the C2399A SNP genotype in the local Black and Coloured African population in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were randomly recruited from the hypertension clinic at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. EDTA blood samples were collected from patients with a known history of AEi caused by enalapril (n = 24) and controls with hypertension on enalapril with no incidence of AEi for at least 2 years (n = 85). Allele-specific primers were used for the detection of the C or A allele associated with XPNPEP2. Female patients were also being investigated for X-inactivation patterns to detect subtle skewing of the ratio. To date a total of 24 patients with AEi have been tested, 18 were female (75%), 13 coloured (54%) and 11 (46%) Black African. When compared with controls 29% of Black African and 8% of coloured patients attending the hypertension clinic had a history of AEi. There were no gender differences between AEi patients and controls. All male patients exhibited either A or C allele genotypes. All female patients exhibited CC, AA or CA genotypes. In AEi patients the A allele frequency was 16% in males and 26% in females. In controls the A allele frequency was 33% in males and 28% in females. Lyonization of the X allele in females is still being investigated. In conclusion, more female than male and more Black African than coloured patients presented with enalapril-induced angio- edema at the hypertension clinic in Cape Town South Africa. Preliminary results indicate no association with C2399A in the XPNPEP2 gene to angioedema in these patients.","L70004856 2009-11-27","10.1111/j.1365-2125.2009.03451.x","dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor;enalapril;bradykinin;nonapeptide;perindopril;ramipril;aminopeptidase;enzyme;edetic acid;patient;angioneurotic edema;gene;genetic screening;clinical pharmacology;society;female;hypertension;male;allele;outpatient department;genotype;city;adverse drug reaction;South Africa;population;gene frequency;X chromosome inactivation;single nucleotide polymorphism;membrane;X chromosome;diabetes mellitus;Caucasian;congestive heart failure;hospital;blood sampling;sex difference;anaphylaxis;edema;Angioedema;Genetic Testing;Mass Screening",NA,NA

In species with heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the sex of the individual is established at the time of formation of the zygote, leading to inherent sex differences in expression of sex chromosome genes beginning as soon as the embryonic transcriptome is activated. The inequality of sex chromosome gene expression causes sexual differentiation of the gonads and of non-gonadal tissues. The difference in gonad type in turn causes lifelong differences in gonadal hormones, which interact with unequal effects of X and Y genes acting within cells. Separating the effects of gonadal hormones and sex chromosomes has been possible using mouse models in which gonadal determination is separated from the sex chromosomes, allowing comparison of XX and XY mice with the same type of gonad. Sex differences caused by gonadal hormones and sex chromosomes affect basic physiology and disease mechanisms in most or all tissues.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 24 Total Times Cited: 24 Cited Reference Count: 95","10.1016/bs.ctdb.2019.01.003","dimorphic gene-expression;x-chromosome inactivation;y-chromosome;dosage compensation;stroke sensitivity;mouse models;complement;brain;evolution;hormones;Gonads",NA,NA

Prior to genome-wide reprogramming, X upregulation is present, consistent with Ohno's hypothesis. Subsequently, however, it is erased. In females, erasure follows loss of X inactivation, causing XÂ dosage excess. Conversely, in males, erasure leadsÂ to permanent X dosage decompensation. Sex chromosomally abnormal models exhibit a âsex-reversedâ X dosage state: XX males, like XX females, develop X dosage excess, while XO females, like XY males, develop X dosage decompensation. Thus, germline X dosage compensation states are determined by X chromosome number, not phenotypic sex.

Although males generally exhibit severe symptoms, due to variable X inactivation, females can also be severely impacted. Osteoporosis is a disease of the skeleton predisposing patients to fragility fracture, a cause of significant morbidity and mortality and a common comorbidity in HA. Because the causes of osteoporosis in HA are unclear and in humans confounded by other traditional risk factors for bone loss, in this study, we phenotyped the skeletons of F8 total knockout (F8TKO) mice, an animal model of severe HA. We found that trabecular bone accretion in the axial and appendicular skeletons of male F8TKO mice lagged significantly between 2 and 6 months of age, with more modest cortical bone decline. By contrast, in female mice, diminished bone accretion was mostly limited to the cortical compartment. Interestingly, bone loss was associated with a decline in bone formation in male mice but increased bone resorption in female mice, a possible result of sex steroid insufficiency. In conclusion, our studies reveal a sexual dimorphism in the mechanism driving bone loss in male and female F8TKO mice, preventing attainment of peak bone mass and strength. If validated in humans, therapies aimed at promoting bone formation in males but suppressing bone resorption in females may be indicated to facilitate attainment of peak mass in children with HA to reduce the risk for fracture later in life.","L2001590511 2019-02-22 2019-03-01","10.1182/bloodadvances.2018027557","amino terminal telopeptide;carboxy terminal telopeptide;collagen type 1;procollagen;sex hormone;animal cell;animal experiment;animal model;animal tissue;appendicular skeleton;article;bone density;bone mass;bone metabolism;bone microarchitecture;bone strength;bone structure;bone turnover;C57BL 6 mouse;cell count;cell surface;controlled study;cortical bone;cortical thickness (bone);dual energy X ray absorptiometry;female;femur;fracture;hemophilia A;juvenile animal;knockout mouse;male;micro-computed tomography;morphometry;mouse;nonhuman;ossification;osteoclast;osteolysis;phenotype;priority journal;risk factor;sex difference;trabecular bone;vertebra;Factor XI Deficiency;Hemophilia A;Bone Resorption;Hemophilia B;Mice;Osteogenesis",NA,NA

In fact, the female sex is a significant risk factor for the development of DED. This sex-related difference in DED prevalence is attributed in large part to the effects of sex steroids (e.g. androgens, estrogens), hypothalamic-pituitary hormones, glucocorticoids, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and thyroid hormones, as well as to the sex chromosome complement, sex-specific autosomal factors and epigenetics (e.g. microRNAs). In addition to sex, gender also appears to be a risk factor for DED. âGenderâ and âsexâ are words that are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings. âGenderâ refers to a person's self-representation as a man or woman, whereas âsexâ distinguishes males and females based on their biological characteristics. Both gender and sex affect DED risk, presentation of the disease, immune responses, pain, care-seeking behaviors, service utilization, and myriad other facets of eye health. Overall, sex, gender and hormones play a major role in the regulation of ocular surface and adnexal tissues, and in the difference in DED prevalence between women and men.

Such variations, which have only recently been appreciated, do not interfere with the strategy of establishing a single active X, but they influence how it is carried out. In an overview of X dosage compensation in human cells, I point out the evolutionary variations. I also argue that it is the single active X that is chosen, rather than inactive ones. Further, I suggest that the initial events in the process-those that precede silencing of future inactive X chromosomes-include randomly choosing the future active X, most likely by repressing its XIST locus.

Several recent findings about the X and Y chromosomes must be reckoned with in considering determinants of longevity which derive from genotypic sex. The advantages of having two X chromosomes are apparent, notwithstanding X-chromosome inactivation. Not only can some cells compensate for biosynthetic deficiencies of others, but also cell selection according to which X chromosome is active can occur during development according to cell viability and proliferative capacity. It has recently been observed that at least some genes on inactive X chromosomes are reactivated late in life. Details of the reactivation process must be studied to determine its significance and the effects of the process on late life survival. The recent mapping of the catalytic polypeptide of DNA-polymerase-alpha to the X chromosome calls attention to a new property of the genotype which could affect the basic ability of cells to proliferate. It is likely that this enzyme, perhaps in concert with DNA-polymerase-delta, is required for DNA replication, suggesting that two alleles for this enzyme and cell selection within the female phenotypic mosaic for DNA replication may provide a sex-linked determinant of cell proliferation which could be advantageous in late life. Much remains to be learned about the Y chromosome, although there are early results consistent with a determinant of longevity on that chromosome which operates to the male disadvantage and probably does not involve sex hormones. The genotype may be a significant determinant of longevity in humans even if it does not appear to be so in non-human animals, because causes of death are different. Determinants of longevity are based on susceptibility or vulnerability to the causes and diseases of mortality, and these differ in different species.","Smith, D W Warner, H R Journal Article Review England 1989/01/01 Exp Gerontol. 1989;24(4):277-88. doi: 10.1016/0531-5565(89)90001-6.","10.1016/0531-5565(89)90001-6","Female;Genotype;Humans;*Longevity;Male;Sex Factors;Longevity",NA,NA

What role the X chromosome plays in the disease has always been an intriguing question. In this study, we examined the genetic variants on the X chromosome through meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on SLE on Chinese Han populations. Prominent association signals from the meta-analysis were replicated in 4 additional Asian cohorts, with a total of 5373 cases and 9166 matched controls. We identified a novel variant in PRPS2 on Xp22.3 as associated with SLE with genome-wide significance (rs7062536, OR = 0.84, P = 1.00E-08). Association of the L1CAM-MECP2 region with SLE was reported previously. In this study, we identified independent contributors in this region in NAA10 (rs2071128, OR = 0.81, P = 2.19E-13) and TMEM187 (rs17422, OR = 0.75, P = 1.47E-15), in addition to replicating the association from IRAK1-MECP2 region (rs1059702, OR = 0.71, P = 2.40E-18) in Asian cohorts. The X-linked susceptibility variants showed higher effect size in males than that in females, similar to results from a genome-wide survey of associated SNPs on the autosomes. These results suggest that susceptibility genes identified on the X chromosome, while contributing to disease predisposition, might not contribute significantly to the female predominance of this prototype autoimmune disease.","L602194945 2015-02-19 2015-02-24","10.1093/hmg/ddu429","interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1;methyl CpG binding protein 2;article;autosome;correlation analysis;female;gene;gene frequency;gene linkage disequilibrium;gene replication;genetic association;genetic identification;genetic risk;genetic susceptibility;genetic variability;genotype;Han Chinese;human;immunopathogenesis;l1cam gene;male;naa10 gene;priority journal;promoter region;prps2 gene;sex difference;single nucleotide polymorphism;systemic lupus erythematosus;tmem187 gene;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome;Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic",NA,NA

However, some X-linked genes show variable X inactivation, being expressed from the inactive X in some females but subject to inactivation in other women. The human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP1) gene falls into this category. As TIMP1 and its target metalloproteinases are involved in many biological processes, women with elevated TIMP1 expression may exhibit different disease susceptibilities. To address the potential impact of variable X inactivation, we analyzed TIMP1 expression levels by using an RNase protection assay. The substantial variation of TIMP1 expression observed in cells with monoallelic TIMP1 expression precluded analysis of the contribution of the inactive X to total TIMP1 RNA levels in females, so we examined expression in rodent/human somatic cell hybrids. TIMP1 expression levels varied more widely in hybrids retaining an inactive X than in those with an active X chromosome, suggesting variable retention of the epigenetic silencing mechanisms associated with X inactivation. Therefore, we investigated the contribution of methylation at the promoter to expression level variation and found that methylation of the TIMP1 promoter correlated with instability and low level expression, whereas stable TIMP1 expression from the inactive X equivalent to that seen from the active X chromosome was observed when the promoter was unmethylated. Since all female cell lines examined showed methylation of the TIMP1 promoter, the contribution of expression from the inactive X appears minimal. However, as women age, they may accumulate cells stably expressing TIMP1 from the inactive X, with a resulting increase of TIMP1, which may explain some sex differences in various late-onset disorders.

We assessed whether (CAG)n affects the sequence of the androgen-sensitive pubertal events and body composition in prepubertal girls. Design, Setting, Participants, and Interventions: Nested case-control study within the Growth and Obesity Cohort Study of 1196 low-middle income children (approximately 50% girls) from a university clinic in Santiago, Chile. Cases were girls with high dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS; >42 Î¼g/dL; HD) at age 7.0 (Â±0.4) years (n = 58). On follow-up, 32 of them had thelarche (TB2) before the age of pubarche (PH2) and 26 had PH2 before the age of TB2. As controls, 107 age-matched girls with normal DHEAS (â¤42 Î¼g/dL; ND) were selected. Main Outcome Measures: Methylation-weighted mean (CAG)n (mw[CAG]n) was calculated through X-chromosome methylation-sensitive enzyme restriction and polymerase chain reaction followed by automated capillary electrophoresis in peripheral blood DNA. Results: Girls with HD and PH2 before the age of TB2 showed a trend to higher frequency (7/26, 26.9%) of mw(CAG)n <20 compared with ND girls (12/107; 11.2%; P =.087). Accordingly, a direct correlation between age of PH2 and mw(CAG)n was observed in HD (r = 0.352; P =.007) and in ND girls (r = 0.207; P =.033). Moreover, HD girls with mw(CAG)n less than 20 had lower waist circumference and waist/height ratio than HD girls with mw(CAG)n from 20 to less than 25 (P =.027 and P =.012, respectively) at age of DHEAS determination. Conclusion: Our results suggest that a greater transcriptional activity of the AR, given by short number of CAG repeats, might favor the onset of pubarche and reduce central adiposity in prepubertal girls with HD.","L2001539872 2019-02-11 2019-06-17","10.1016/j.jpag.2018.11.012","androgen receptor;prasterone sulfate;restriction endonuclease;androgen blood level;article;birth weight;body composition;body fat;body mass;breast development;CAG repeat;capillary electrophoresis;case control study;child;childhood obesity;Chilean;controlled study;fat mass;female;follow up;gene frequency;genetic polymorphism;human;major clinical study;methylation;observational study;polymerase chain reaction;prepuberty;priority journal;protein function;school child;secondary sexual characteristics;waist circumference;waist to height ratio;X chromosome inactivation;Receptors, Androgen;Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate;Polymorphism, Genetic;Dehydroepiandrosterone",NA,NA

Structural equation modeling was used to model a female problem behavior phenotype, which included conduct problems, substance use, impulsive-sensation seeking, interpersonal aggression, and prenatal smoking. All of the female problem behavior dimensions clustered together strongly, with the exception of prenatal smoking. A main effect of MAOA genotype and a MAOA x physical maltreatment interaction were detected with the Conduct Problems factor. Our phenotypic model showed that prenatal smoking is not simply a marker of other maternal problem behaviors.

In this perspective, we highlight epidemiological evidence of sex differences in melanoma and summarize the landscape of their potential origin.

However, the relationship of these with each other and with RA disease is complicated as both genes and environment may be protective or render individuals susceptible. Diagnostic certainty and disease heterogeneity have posed serious hurdles for investigating RA. Patients with similar disease phenotypes may have different aetiologies and it may now be more appropriate to investigate genetic susceptibility with respect to disease process or characteristic immunopathology. Disease concordance studies have been a classical approach to estimating the upper threshold of the genetic contribution to RA and recent studies have approximately halved the much quoted figure of 32% reported by Lawrence for RA concordance in monozygotic twins. However, the interpretation of twin data has to be treated with caution as MZ twins can differ in terms of somatic rearrangement/mutation of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes, X chromosome inactivation in females, genomic imprinting and in utero immune relationship. Calculations based on heritability put the genetic component in RA much higher. HLA is an important genetic factor in RA and risk is thought to be associated with a consensus sequence of amino acids within the third hypervariable region of certain DRB1 alleles. It is now clear that HLA is not particularly associated with onset of synovitis but is more associated with progression and severity of the disease process. The HLA-DRB1*0401/0404 genotype is particularly associated with severe, erosive and seropositive RA. Clear differences in RA susceptibility exist between males and females and this may be attributed to hormonal status. Males have a higher threshold requirement for developing RA and this may explain why RA in males is more associated with HLA risk alleles. We have now reached a critical time for the investigation of RA aetio-pathology. Recent advances in molecular biology and automated microsatellite gene scanning technology are making it possible to map disease susceptibility genes over the whole genome in common disorders such as RA. This will require large numbers of well characterised multiplex affected families. It is anticipated that some of the genes identified will fit in with our current concepts of which inflammatory and immune processes are pathologically important in RA.

Using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, we analyzed 57 MspI sites (32 sites in the CpG islands, and 25 nonclustered sites) from five X-linked housekeeping genes (HPRT, G6PD, P3, PGK, and GLA) and two tissue specific genes (X-linked F9 and autosomal EPO). Methylation patterns were compared to those of male germ cells, sperm, and somatic tissues of both sexes. All 32 MspI sites in CpG islands were unmethylated in germ-cell fractions of fetal ovary and adult testes, which could explain the reversibility of X inactivation in these tissues. However, whereas male meiotic germ cells were extensively methylated outside the islands (in the body of genes) and the methylation patterns resembled those of most somatic tissues, none of the 25 nonclustered CpGs was methylated in DNA contributed by the germ-cell component of fetal ovaries. The presence of faint MspI-like fragments in HpaII digests of fetal testes as well as fetal ovary prior to the onset of meiosis suggests that DNA of primordial germ cells is unmethylated in both sexes. Our observations of meiotic germ cells suggest that the female germ cells remain unmethylated, but that methylation in male germ cells occurs postnatally, prior to or during the early stages of spermatogenesis. In any event, the striking sex difference in methylation status of endogenous single-copy genes in meiotic germ cells could provide a molecular basis for parental imprinting of the mammalian genome.","L20214475 1990-08-17","10.1007/bf01233363","radioisotope;article;cell culture;DNA methylation;human;human cell;nonhuman;normal human;priority journal;sex difference;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Sex Characteristics;X Chromosome",NA,NA

Of particular interest is ProtocadherinX (PCDH11X or PCDHX ), a recently described gene expressed in brain. In humans, PCDH11X has a homologue on the Y chromosome and is predicted to escape from X-inactivation. Employing bisulphite sequencing analysis we found absence of CpG island methylation on both the active and the inactive X chromosomes, providing a strong indication that PCDH11X escapes inactivation in humans. Furthermore, a sexual dimorphism in levels of expression in brain tissue was observed by quantitative real-time PCR, with females presenting an up to 2-fold excess in the abundance of PCDH11X transcripts. We relate these findings to sexually dimorphic traits in the human brain. Interestingly, PCDH11X /Y gene pair is unique to Homo sapiens, since the X-linked gene was transposed to the Y chromosome after the human-chimpanzee lineages split. Although no differences in promoter methylation were found between humans and chimpanzees, evidence of an upregulation of PCDH11X in humans deserves further investigation.

At birth, Trp53 nullizygous mice were predominantly XY rather than XX, irrespective of gonadal type, showing that the sex difference in the lethal effect of Trp53 nullizygosity by postnatal day 1 is caused by differences in sex chromosome complement. At 10.5 dpc, the incidence of NTDs in Trp53-null progeny of XY* mice, among which the number of the X chromosomes varies independently of the presence or absence of a Y chromosome, was higher in mice with two copies of the X chromosome than in mice with a single copy.

Surprisingly, sex differences, which are integral to metabolic and immune health and disease, have received a short shrift from researchers in this field. The purpose of this chapter in this protocols book in the Immunometabolism: Methods in Molecular Biology series is to bring attention to this understudied, but crucial, feature of immunometabolism within the scientific community. Sex differences in adipose (and by extension, metabolic) and immune functions are pervasive in metabolic and immune health and disease; it is likely that a better insight into them may open new research directions to better capitalize on the promising discoveries made in this field, and thereby contribute to the development of sex-based precision medicine. It is counterintuitive to ignore a fundamental aspect of immunometabolism, and thereby limit our ability to capitalize on its promising features in improving or maintaining health, and for the therapeutic targeting of associated diseases.

Here we report two affected female patients with OFCD, a mother and daughter, who both had congenital cataracts, microphthalmia, characteristic dental anomalies, and typical facial dysmorphisms. These features were diagnostic for OFCD; thus, these cases represent the second documented instance of mother-to-daughter OFCD transmission. In addition to the clinical features typically seen in OFCD individuals, the affected daughter exhibited several additional congenital anomalies including intestinal malrotation and hypoplastic thumbs. Thus, these cases further define and expand the OFCD clinical phenotype. These two individuals also displayed a skewed pattern of X chromosome inactivation.

In Family 1, a 19-year-old male had facial features consistent with fragile X syndrome; however, his profound mental and growth retardation, small testes, and lover limb skeletal defects and contractures demonstrated a more severe phenotype, suggestive of a contiguous gene syndrome. A cytogenetic deletion including Xq26.3-q27.3 was observed in the proband, his phenotypically normal mother, and his learning-disabled non-dysmorphic sister. Methylation analyses at the FMR1 and androgen receptor loci indicated that the deleted X was inactive in > 95% of his mother's white blood cells and 80-85% of the sister's leukocytes. The proximal breakpoint for the deletion was approximately 10 Mb centromeric to FMR1, and the distal breakpoint mapped 1 Mb distal to FMR1. This deletion, encompassing ~ 13 Mb of DNA, is the largest deletion including FMR1 reported to date. In the second family, a slightly smaller deletion was detected. A female with moderate to severe mental retardation, seizures, and hypothyroidism, had a de novo cytogenetic deletion extending from Xq26.3 to q27.3, which removed ~ 12 Mb of DNA around the FMR1 gene. Cytogenetic and molecular data revealed that ~ 50% of her white blood cells contained an active deleted X. These findings indicate that males with deletions including Xq26.3-q27.3 may exhibit a more severe phenotype than typical fragile X males, and females with similar deletions may have an abnormal phenotype if the deleted X remains active in a significant proportion of the cells. Thus, important genes for intellectual and neurological development, in addition to FMR1, may reside in Xq26.3-q27.3. One candidate gene in this region, SOX3, is thought to be involved in neuronal development and its loss may partly explain the more severe phenotypes of our patients.","L27338801 1997-08-25","10.1007/s004390050501","androgen receptor;microsatellite DNA;article;chromosome breakage;chromosome deletion X;chromosome Xq;controlled study;cytogenetics;DNA methylation;female;fluorescence in situ hybridization;fragile X syndrome;growth retardation;human;human cell;hypothyroidism;leukocyte;male;mental retardation malformation syndrome;phenotype;priority journal;receptor gene;seizure;sex difference;skeleton malformation;testis disease;X chromosome inactivation;Phenotype",NA,NA

Early exposure to androgenic hormones and early maternal immune activation comprise environmental factors affecting sex-specific susceptibility to ASD.

Alterations in DNA methylation are established contributors to inter-individual phenotypic variation and have been associated with disease susceptibility. The degree to which changes in loci-specific DNA methylation are under the influence of heritable and environmental factors is unknown. In this study, we quantitatively measured DNA methylation across the promoter regions of the dopamine receptor 4 gene (DRD4), the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4/SERT) and the monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA) using DNA sampled at both ages 5 and 10 years in 46 MZ twin-pairs and 45 DZ twin-pairs (total n = 182). We observed high levels of MZ twin discordance in DNA methylation and dynamic changes in individual DNA methylation across all three regions between ages 5 and 10 years. Variation in DRD4 DNA methylation was mostly attributable to environmental factors that were shared among children growing up in the same family whilst inter-individual differences in SERT DNA methylation were primarily attributable to unique environmental factors experienced by each child in the family, and not to shared events or heritable factors. We observed a more complex pattern of results for the MAOA amplicon with noticeable sex differences in twin concordance at both ages and for change over time, as expected for a gene mediated by X-inactivation. Our longitudinaldevelopmental study suggests that DNA methylation differences are apparent already in early childhood and there are DNA methylation differences between genetically identical individuals (i.e. MZ twins). Moreover, environmental influences are important factors accounting for interindividual DNA methylation differences and individual differences in methylation over time are not stable. While these findings confirm the utility of DNA methylation as a biomarker of environmental influences, they also identify new and important concerns about using cross-sectional approaches to studying and drawing inferences in epigenomics.","L70236572 2010-08-18","","DNA;biological marker;amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme A;serotonin transporter;dopamine receptor;twins;longitudinal study;DNA methylation;gene;environmental factor;child;methylation;gene expression;phenotypic variation;disease predisposition;promoter region;twin discordance;amplicon;sex difference;twin concordance;X chromosome inactivation;childhood;Longitudinal Studies;Twins",NA,NA

This random X-inactivation process also occurs during in vitro differentiation of female embryonic stem (ES) cells. A locus on the X chromosome, the X inactivation centre (Xic) is initially 'counted', given that at least two copies of Xic must be present per diploid genome in order for inactivation to occur. The counting process ensures that one X chromosome remains active in diploid cells. In the mouse, the essential functions of Xic can be assured by a 450-kb region containing the Xist gene. Xist maps within Xic (refs 7-10) and is necessary in cis for inactivation. The Xist transcript is a 15-kb RNA which is confined within the nucleus and coats the inactive X chromosome. In order to characterize functional elements within Xic and the Xist gene, we created a 65-kb cre/loxP deletion extending 3' to Xist exon 6. In undifferentiated ES cells, Xist expression from the deleted X chromosome was markedly reduced. In differentiated XX ES cells containing one deleted X chromosome, the X inactivation process still occurred but was never initiated from the unmutated X chromosome. In differentiated ES cells that were essentially XO, the mutated Xic was capable of initiating X inactivation, even in the absence of another Xic. These results demonstrate a role for the region 3' to Xist exon 6 in the counting process and suggest that counting is mediated by a repressive mechanism which prevents inactivation of a single X chromosome in diploid cells.","L28309335 1998-08-20","10.1038/924","animal cell;article;cell death;cell differentiation;deletion mutant;diploidy;embryo development;exon;gene locus;gene mapping;nonhuman;nucleotide sequence;priority journal;sex difference;stem cell;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome;Exons",NA,NA

To determine a putative association of skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and PD, we examined XCI patterns using a human androgen receptor gene-based assay (HUMARA) and did not identify any association of skewed or random X inactivation with clinical heterogeneity among female PD patients. In addition, we sought to determine methylation-specific changes at the X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) locus, which is known to be responsible for initiating X inactivation. We observed a trend towards hypomethylation in the gene body region of the XIST locus in PD females which did not reach significance. Furthermore, we extended our analysis of DNA methylation across the entire X-chromosome which revealed no methylation-specific differences between PD females and healthy controls. Thus, we propose that skewed XCI and methylation levels on the entire X chromosome did not reveal changes which could account for the decreased PD susceptibility in females or suitable to use as a biomarker.","1558-1497 Sharma, Amit Kaut, Oliver Pavlova, Anna FrÃ¶hlich, Holger Ahmad, Ashar Schmitt, Ina El-Maarri, Osman Oldenburg, Johannes WÃ¼llner, Ullrich Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States 2017/07/01 Neurobiol Aging. 2017 Sep;57:248.e1-248.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2017.05.021.

We investigated susceptibility to UV suppression in reciprocal F1-hybrid and backcross mice derived from BALB/c (low susceptibility) and C57BL/6 (high susceptibility) inbred strains. CB6F1 male mice exhibited high susceptibility and B6CF1 male mice exhibited low susceptibility, indicating a major X-linked effect in the genetic control of UV immune suppression. Females of either F1 hybrid showed intermediate suppression, consistent with random X-inactivation. A model of monogenic X-linked control was not sufficient, and evidence for the action of two genetically unlinked autosomal genes was found in parental backcross animals. Both sexes of (BALB/c x CB6F1) mice showed a 1 high : 1 low ratio of phenotypes, indicating control by a major autosomal locus, Uvs1, confirmed by propagation of the high phenotype through selective backcrossing for nine generations to BALB/c. Uvs1 was not genetically linked to 12 chromosomal markers including the pigment genes b (brown) and c (albino). Backcross animals (C57BL/6 x CB6F1) showed a significant sex difference, male mice giving a 3 high : 1 low ratio of phenotypes, compatible with the action of a second autosomal locus, Uvs2, in this hybrid. The findings are compatible with a model in which high phenotype (Uvs1b/Uvs1b) is dominant when subjected to recessive epistatis by the X-chromosome locus Uvs3, or by the autosomal locus Uvs2. The finding of genetic control by interacting autosomal and X-linked genes is unique.

Traditionally, in mammals, sex determination is considered equivalent to gonadal determination. Since the presence or the absence of the testes ultimately determines the phenotype of the external genitalia, sex determination is typically seen as equivalent to testis determination. But what exactly does sex determine? The endpoint of sex determination is almost invariably seen as the reproductive structures, which represent the most obvious phenotypic difference between the sexes. One could argue that the most striking differences between males and females are not the anatomy of the genitals, but the size of the gametes-considerably larger in females than males. In fact, there could be many different endpoints to sex determination, leading to differences between the sexes: brain sexual differences, behavioral differences, and susceptibility to disease. The central dogma of sexual differentiation, stemming initially from the gonad-transfer experiments of Alfred Jost, is that sexual dimorphisms of all somatic tissues are dependent on the testicular secretion of the developing fetus. In this chapter, we will take the example of sex differences in brain and behavior as an endpoint of sex determination. We will argue that genetic factors play a role in sexually dimorphic traits such as the number of dopaminergic cells in the mesencephalon, aggression, and sexual orientation, independently from gonadal hormones.

This result was unexpected since female ICF patients are not more severely affected than male patients. Here we show that CpG island methylation is abnormal in some ICF patients but in other ICF patients, the difference in methylation pattern between Xi and Xa (active X) is maintained. The consequences of Xi undermethylation on gene expression were investigated by enzyme assays. They showed that significant gene expression did not correlate with CpG island methylation status. The widespread Xi undermethylation does not affect overall Xi replication timing and does not prevent Barr body formation suggesting that a normal methylation pattern is not required for normal chromatin organization of Xi. Molecular investigation of some X-chromosome intron regions showed that the methylation changes in ICF female patients extend to non CpG islands sequences.

We show that XCI at 683 X-chromosomal genes is generally uniform across human tissues, but identify examples of heterogeneity between tissues, individuals and cells. We show that incomplete XCI affects at least 23% of X-chromosomal genes, identify seven genes that escape XCI with support from multiple lines of evidence and demonstrate that escape from XCI results in sex biases in gene expression, establishing incomplete XCI as a mechanism that is likely to introduce phenotypic diversity6,7. Overall, this updated catalogue of XCI across human tissues helps to increase our understanding of the extent and impact of the incompleteness in the maintenance of XCI.","L618728098 2017-10-23 2019-10-31","10.1038/nature24265","transcriptome;article;female;gene expression;gene sequence;human;male;phenotypic variation;priority journal;sex difference;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;X Chromosome",NA,NA

J.","",NA,NA,NA,"Sex chromosomes originate as a pair of homologus autosomes that then follow a general pattern of divergence. This is evident in mammalian sex chromosomes, which have undergone stepwise recombination suppression events that left footprints of evolutionary strata on the X chromosome. The loss of genes on the Y chromosome led to Ohno's hypothesis of dosage equivalence between XY males and XX females, which is achieved through X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). This process transcriptionally silences all but one X chromosome in each female cell, although 15-30% of human X-linked genes still escape inactivation. There are multiple evolutionary pathways that may lead to a gene escaping XCI, including remaining Y chromosome homology, or female advantage to escape. The conservation of some escape genes across multiple species and the ability of the mouse inactive X to recapitulate human escape status both suggest that escape from XCI is controlled by conserved processes. Evolutionary pressures to minimize dosage imbalances have led to the accumulation of genetic elements that favor either silencing or escape; lack of dosage sensitivity might also allow for the escape of flanking genes near another escapee, if a boundary element is not present between them. Delineation of the elements involved in escape is progressing, but mechanistic understanding of how they interact to allow escape from XCI is still lacking. Although increasingly well-studied in humans and mice, non-trivial challenges to studying escape have impeded progress in other species. Mouse models that can dissect the role of the sex chromosomes distinct from sex of the organism reveal an important contribution for escape genes to multiple diseases. In humans, with their elevated number of escape genes, the phenotypic consequences of sex chromosome aneuplodies and sexual dimorphism in disease both highlight the importance of escape genes.","2296-634x Posynick, Bronwyn J Brown, Carolyn J Journal Article Review Switzerland 2019/11/07 Front Cell Dev Biol. 2019 Oct 22;7:241. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2019.00241. eCollection 2019.","10.3389/fcell.2019.00241","X-chromosome inactivation;dosage compensation;escape from X-chromosome inactivation;gametologues;mammalian evolution;sex chromosomes;X Chromosome",NA,NA

Expression from the inactive X allele varies from a few percent of that from the active allele to near equal expression. While most genes have a stable inactivation pattern, a subset of genes exhibit tissue-specific differences in escape from X inactivation. Escape genes appear to be protected from the repressive chromatin modifications associated with X inactivation. Differences in the identity and distribution of escape genes between species and tissues suggest a role for these genes in the evolution of sex differences in specific phenotypes.

C banding showed that the breakpoint in chromosome 1 had occurred within the centromeric heterochromatin. Part of the heterochromatin region was translocated onto the short arm of chromosome 13, thus forming a dicentric chromosome. The abnormal chromosome 1 consisted of the short arm and a small region of centromeric heterochromatin. No part of chromosome 13 was apparently translocated onto chromosome 1. Ag staining showed that the translocated 1;13 chromosome retained the active NORs and was participating in satellite association. No chromosome studies on the family have yet been possible. It would be interesting to establish through family studies if the translocation is de novo or inherited. A de novo event is more likely in view of the non-reciprocal nature of the rearrangement. The important question is to determine the relationship between infertility and observed chromosomal anomalies in infertile men. In sex chromosome aneuploidies the association is obvious. The role of autosomal rearrangements is more difficult to explain. It seems unlikely that spermatogenic arrest in heterozygotes for chromosome rearrangements could be the result of altered expression of genes at (or near) the chromosome breakpoint, as too many genes would have to be involved in spermatogenesis. Perhaps the hypothesis of Forejt provides a better explanation.

A suppressor could act by boosting the resource demands of competing female embryos. This possibility may explain incidences of the escape from X-inactivation and provides a rationale for why these genes typically have Y-linked homologues. Alternatively, a suppressor could act to decrease the resource demands of males with the selfish Y. This possibility is supported by the finding that the size of male, but not female, human infants is negatively correlated to the number of X chromosomes. A protracted arms race between a selfish gene and its suppressor may ensue. Both the variation in copy number of Zfy and the unusually fast sequence evolution of Sry may be explained by such an arms race. As required by the model, human Sry is known to have an X-linked suppressor. Preliminary evidence suggests that, as predicted, rapid sequence evolution of Sry may be correlated with female promiscuity.

In humans, they reside at the ends of the X and Y chromosomes and encompass roughly 2.7 Mb (PAR1) and 0.33 Mb (PAR2). As a major asset of recently available sequence data, our view of their structural characteristics could be refined considerably. While PAR2 resembles the overall sequence composition of the X chromosome and exhibits only slightly elevated recombination rates, PAR1 is characterized by a significantly higher GC content and a completely different repeat structure. In addition, it exhibits one of the highest recombination frequencies throughout the entire human genome and, probably as a consequence of its structural features, displays a significantly faster rate of evolution. It therefore represents an exceptional model to explore the correlation between meiotic recombination and evolutionary forces such as gene mutation and conversion. At least twenty-nine genes lie within the human pseudoautosomal regions, and these genes exhibit 'autosomal' rather than sex-specific inheritance. All genes within PAR1 escape X inactivation and are therefore candidates for the etiology of haploinsufficiency disorders including Turner syndrome (45,X). However, the only known disease gene within the pseudoautosomal regions is the SHORT STATURE HOMEBOX (SHOX) gene, functional loss of which is causally related to various short stature conditions and disturbed bone development.

In the current study weanling C56BL/6J mice were used to examine sex differences in the Calb protein and message focusing on regions outside of the hypothalamus. A robust sex difference was found in Calb in the frontal cortex (FC) and cerebellum (CB; specifically in Purkinje cells); mRNA and protein were higher in females than in males. Using 2 mouse lines, i.e. one with a complete deletion of estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and the other with uncoupled gonads and sex chromosomes, we probed the mechanisms that underlie sexual dimorphisms. In the FC, deletion of ER alpha reduced Calb1 mRNA in females compared to males. In addition, females with XY sex chromosomes had levels of Calb1 equal to those of males. Thus, both ER alpha and the sex chromosome complement regulate Calb1 in the FC. In the CB, ER alpha knockout mice of both sexes had reduced Calb1 mRNA, yet sex differences were retained. However, the sex chromosome complement, regardless of gonadal sex, dictated Calb1 mRNA levels. Mice with XX chromosomes had significantly greater Calb1 than did XY mice.

These genes are enriched on the short arm of the X chromosome, and, in addition to genes in the pseudoautosomal regions, include genes with and without Y-chromosomal counterparts. We highlight candidate escape genes for some of the features of Klinefelter syndrome and discuss our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying silencing and escape on the X chromosome as well as additional differences between the X in males and females that may contribute to Klinefelter syndrome.","L2005008718 2020-05-28","10.1002/ajmg.c.31800","aneuploidy;body build;DNA methylation;epigenetics;gene expression;gene silencing;human;immune response;Klinefelter syndrome;malignant neoplasm;nerve cell differentiation;nonhuman;priority journal;review;sex difference;somatic cell;spermatogenesis;supernumerary chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Klinefelter Syndrome;X Chromosome",NA,NA

Uniquely, thyroid cancer (TC) is the only nonreproductive cancer with striking female predominance with three- to four-fold higher incidence among females, although males generally have more aggressive disease. The molecular basis for this observation is not known, and current approaches in treatment and surveillance are not sex specific. Summary: Although TC has overall good prognosis, 6-20% of patients develop regional or distant metastasis, one third of whom are not responsive to conventional treatment approaches and suffer a 10-year survival rate of only 10%. More efficacious treatment strategies are needed for these aggressive TCs, as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy have major toxicities without demonstrable overall survival benefit. Emerging evidence indicates a role of sex hormones, genetics, and the immune system in modulation of both risk for TC and its progression in a sex-specific manner. Conclusion: Greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying sex differences in TC pathogenesis could provide insights into the development of sex-specific, targeted, and effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management. This review summarizes emerging evidence for the importance of sex in the pathogenesis, progression, and response to treatment in differentiated TC with emphasis on the role of sex hormones, genetics, and the immune system.","L637680251 2022-04-11 2022-07-15","10.1089/thy.2021.0361","sex hormone;cancer epidemiology;cancer genetics;cancer growth;cancer patient;cancer prognosis;cancer survival;differentiated thyroid cancer;distant metastasis;environmental factor;epigenetics;human;nonhuman;overall survival;review;sex difference;social aspect;survival rate;treatment response;tumor immunity;X chromosome inactivation;Thyroid Neoplasms;Sex Characteristics;Thyroid Gland",NA,NA

Moreover, the terms sex and gender are used interchangeably by many researchers, further complicating the issue. In addition, the sex or gender of the researcher might influence study outcomes, especially those concerning behavioral studies, in both animals and humans. The act of observation may change the outcome (the ""observer effect"") and any experimental manipulation, no matter how well-controlled, is subject to it. This is nowhere more applicable than in physiology and behavior. The sex of established cultured cell lines is another issue, in addition to aneuploidy; chromosomal numbers can change as cells are passaged. Additionally, culture medium contains steroids, growth hormone, and insulin that might influence expression of various genes.

Our aim was to characterize both protein-coding and long non-coding sex-specific transcripts in healthy human placenta using RNA-seq. METHODS: We sequenced total RNA from 88 well phenotyped healthy placentas (40 female and 48 male) collected as part of the Pregnancy Outcome Prediction study in which the placental sample was obtained within 30 minutes of delivery (healthy individual=no hypertension during pregnancy, no diabetes mellitus, delivered a live baby with a birth percentile >=10). We performed quality assessment, trimming and mapping using FastQC, Trim Galore!, and TopHat respectively. Differential gene expression analysis was carried out using edgeR. We validated the significant transcripts in an independent set of 24 samples (12 male-female breech pairs, delivered at term by elective C-section and matched for maternal age, BMI and smoking status). RESULTS: We obtained an average of 102 million reads per sample. We identified 243 differentially-regulated transcripts (DRTs) in the discovery set (FDR<0.05) and validated 84 of these (36 up- and 48 down-regulated in females). Interestingly, 26/84 (31%) DRTs were non-coding RNAs: 18/29 on the Y chr, 6/35 on the X chr and 2/20 on the autosomes. As expected, none of the Y chr transcripts were expressed in females. 28 X chr genes had higher levels of expression in females, indicating escape from X inactivation. But, surprisingly, we also identified 7 protein-coding X chr genes which demonstrated higher levels of expression in males (at least 3 located in the pseudoautosomal regions). 11 protein-coding Y chr genes were expressed in the placenta. All of these had an X chr paralog but only 6 of the X chr paralogs demonstrated escape from X inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Male and female placenta show sex-specific transcript profile differences, and approximately one third are non-coding RNA. (2) Most (76%) DRTs in human placenta are X- or Y-linked. (3) 6/11 X chr genes with an expressed Y chr paralog demonstrated escape from X inactivation, but the remaining 5 did not. (4) Overall, our findings indicate multiple mechanisms leading to sex-specific variation in placental expression of protein coding genes, plus a large number of validated differences in non-protein coding DRTs.","L615322989 2017-04-17","10.1177/1933719117699773","endogenous compound;transcriptome;untranslated RNA;autosome;body mass;controlled study;diabetes mellitus;disease course;DNA transcription;female;gene expression regulation;human;infant;low level laser system;major clinical study;male;maternal age;maternal hypertension;normal human;obstetric delivery;paralogy;placenta;prediction;pregnancy outcome;pseudoautosomal region;quality control;smoking;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Transcriptome;Placenta",NA,NA

RTT is caused by heterozygosity for mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2, which encodes methyl-CpG binding protein 2. MeCP2 is a multifunctional protein that can act as an architectural chromatin-binding protein, a function that is unrelated to its ability to bind methyl-CpG and to attract chromatin modification complexes. Inactivating mutations that cause RTT in females are not prenatally lethal in males, but lead to profound congenital encephalopathy. Molecular diagnoses of RTT, through demonstration of a MECP2 mutation, made at an early stage of the disorder, usually confirm the sporadic nature and very low recurrence risk of the condition. A positive DNA test result, however, also predicts the inevitable clinical course, given the lack of effective intervention. Initial hypotheses indicating that the MeCP2 protein acts as a genome-wide transcriptional repressor were not confirmed by global gene expression studies in various tissues of individuals with RTT and mouse models of MeCP2 deficiency. Rather, recent evidence points to low-magnitude effects of a small number of genes - including the brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway and glucocorticoid response genes - that might affect formation and maturation of synapses or synaptic function in postmitotic neurons.

This leads to pathological glycosphingolipid metabolism, resulting in deposition of glycosphingolipids in lysosomes and body fluids. There is evidence that the glycolipids also accumulate extralysosomally, which is a very important factor in the pathogenic impact. Cardiac involvement is one of the most important disease manifestations because the patients mainly die from cardiac complications. There are two phenotypes: classic and later-onset. First symptoms of the classic phenotype occur during the childhood and include angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, cornea verticillata, and tortuosity of conjunctival and retinal vessels. Young patients typically suffer from acroparaesthesias, abdominal cramping and pain crises. With advancing age, the progressive sphingolipid deposition, particularly in the endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes and podocytes, leads to arterial hypertension, cardiomyopathy, nephropathy and premature strokes. In contrast to the classic phenotype, patients with the later-onset phenotype lack the early disease symptoms. They typically present to the hospital in adulthood with cardiomyopathy or with nephropathy. In females, alpha-galactosidase A activity can range from low to normal owing to random X-chromosome inactivation. Generally, females have a milder phenotype because of the second, unaffected X-chromosome. Patients with Fabry cardiomyopathy suffer from left ventricular hypertrophy, conduction abnormalities and valvular involvement, as well as from diastolic and/or systolic heart failure symptoms. The enzyme activity determination in leucocytes is diagnostic in males but can be misleading in females owing to random X-chromosome deactivation. Thus, genetic testing is suitable for the diagnosis in females and should also be performed in males for the confirmation of the diagnosis. Since 2001, intravenous enzyme replacement therapy has been available for the treatment of patients with Fabry disease. Since 2016, oral pharmacological chaperone therapy has been available for patients with amenable mutations. Substrate reduction and gene therapies are currently in development.","L624736640 2018-11-07 2018-11-13","","alpha galactosidase;chaperone;sphingolipid;abdominal cramp;acroparesthesia;age;anhidrosis;cardiac muscle cell;cardiomyopathy;cerebrovascular accident;chaperone therapy;cornea verticillata;diastolic heart failure;disease association;drug therapy;endothelium cell;enzyme activity;enzyme replacement;Fabry disease;gene therapy;genetic screening;heart left ventricle hypertrophy;heart muscle conduction disturbance;hemangiokeratoma;human;hypertension;keratopathy;kidney disease;leukocyte;lipid storage;paresthesia;phenotype;podocyte;review;sex difference;symptomatology;systolic heart failure;X chromosome inactivation;Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular;Fabry Disease",NA,NA

Nevertheless, our comprehension of how CVD progresses in women and elicits clinical outcomes is lacking, leading CVD to be under-diagnosed and under-treated in women. A clear example of this differential presentation of CVD pathophysiologies in females is the strikingly higher prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Women with a history of pre-eclampsia or those who present with co-morbidities such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of developing HFpEF. Long understood to be a critical CVD risk factor, our understanding of how gender differentially affects the development of CVD has been greatly expanded by extensive genomic and transcriptomic studies. These studies uncovered a pivotal role for differential microRNA (miRNA) expression in response to systemic inflammation, where their co-ordinated expression forms a post-transcriptional regulatory network that instigates microcirculation defects. Importantly, the potential sex-biased expression of the given miRNAs may explain sex-specific cardiovascular pathophysiologies in women, such as HFpEF. Sex-biased miRNAs are regulated by oestrogen (E2) in their transcription and processing or are expressed from loci on the X-chromosome due to incomplete X-chromosome inactivation. Interestingly, while E2-induced miRNAs predominantly appear to serve protective functions, it could be argued that many X-linked miRNAs have been found to challenge microvascular and myocardial integrity. Therefore, menopausal E2 deficiency, resulting in protective miRNA loss, and the augmentation of X-linked miRNA expression, may well contribute to the molecular mechanisms that underlie the female-specific cardiovascular aetiology in HFpEF.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 48 Total Times Cited: 49 Cited Reference Count: 200","10.1093/cvr/cvx223","Women;Sex-biased miRNAs;HFpEF;Microvascular injury;HUMAN ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS;BREAST-CANCER CELLS;PRESSURE-OVERLOAD HYPERTROPHY;LEFT-VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY;ESTROGEN PLUS PROGESTIN;SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS;NITRIC-OXIDE;CIRCULATING MICRORNAS;POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN;INSULIN SENSITIVITY;Cardiovascular Diseases;Heart Failure",NA,NA

Crossing over seems to occur mostly in the terminal third of the X/Y pairing segment. However, crossing-over inhibition control may lapse, or may be somewhat variable, within the pairing segment, so that some loci on the X and Y (e.g. Xg, H-Y, STS, and perhaps others) might cross over with a variable frequency which is proportional to their distances from the telomeres of the short arms. It is postulated that the DNA of the pairing segment is composed in a way which may also permit unequal crossing over to occur between the X and Y, thereby giving rise to exceptions to X- or Y-linked inheritance.

Whether the double dose of X-linked genes in females compared with males leads to sex-specific developmental differences has remained unclear. Using embryonic stem cells with distinct sex chromosome compositions as a model system, we show that two X chromosomes stabilize the naive pluripotent state by inhibiting MAPK and Gsk3 signaling and stimulating the Akt pathway. Since MAPK signaling is required to exit the pluripotent state, differentiation is paused in female cells as long as both X chromosomes are active. By preventing XCI or triggering it precociously, we demonstrate that this differentiation block is released once XX cells have undergone X inactivation. We propose that double X dosage interferes with differentiation, thus ensuring a tight coupling between X chromosome dosage compensation and development.

A similar comparison between X-linked entries and a subset of randomly chosen entries from the remaining autosomes also indicates an excess of genes on the X chromosome with one or more mutations affecting sex determination (e.g. DAX1), sexual differentiation (e.g. androgen receptor) or reproduction (e.g. POF1). A possible reason for disproportionate occurrence of such genes on the X chromosome could be that, during evolution, the 'choice' of a particular pair of homomorphic chromosomes for specialization as sex chromosomes may be related to the number of such genes initially present in it or, since sex determination and sexual dimorphism are often gene dose-dependent processes, the number of such genes necessary to be regulated in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis of these data shows that XAR, the region which has been added on to the short arm of the X chromosome subsequent to eutherian-marsupial divergence, has nearly as high a proportion of SRR genes as XCR, the conserved region of the X chromosome. These observations are consistent with current hypotheses on the evolution of sexually antagonistic traits on sex chromosomes and suggest that both XCR and XAR may have accumulated SRR traits relatively rapidly because of X linkage.","L29048017 1999-02-02","10.1098/rspb.1999.0623","article;autosome;evolution;gene dosage;gene mutation;human;priority journal;reproduction;sex determination;sex difference;sex differentiation;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Chromosomes, Human, X;X Chromosome",NA,NA

However, this compensation is not complete in blastocysts, as a large number of X-linked transcripts are more highly expressed in female embryos than in males. Furthermore, the process of X chromosome inactivation is altered in IVF and cloned porcine embryos, possibly explaining problems of embryo survival with these techniques. The aim of this study was to gain more insights into the transcriptional dynamics of the porcine pre-implantation embryo, with a particular focus on sex-specific differences. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed for individual blastocysts at 8, 10, and 12 days after ovulation, and the temporal development of sexspecific transcripts was analysed. German Landrace sows were cycle synchronized and inseminated with sperm of the same Pietrain boar. On Days 8, 10, and 12 post-insemination, sows were slaughtered and embryos were removed from the uterus using 10mL of PBS (pH 7.4) per horn. Single embryos were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -808C until the extraction of RNA and DNA (AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Using the isolated DNA, the sex of the embryos was determined and 5 female and male embryos, respectively, were analysed per stage. Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA libraries (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were sequenced on a HiSEqn 2500 (Illumina Inc.), and 15 to 25 million 100-bp single-end reads were generated per sample. Reads were filtered and processed using Trimmomatic and mapped to the porcine genome assembly Sscrofa10.2 with TopHat2. Mapped reads were counted by the use of QuasR qCount based on the current National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) GFF3 annotation file. Statistical analysis of count data was performed with the BioConductor R (https://www.bioconductor.org/) package DESEqn 2. At all 3 stages, we found 7 Y-linked transcripts that were highly expressed in male embryos (EIF2S3, EIF1AY, LOC100624590, LOC100625207, LOC100624329, LOC102162178, LOC100624937). On the other hand, 47 X-linked transcripts showed increased expression in female blastocysts, most of them at all 3 time points. However, a small number of genes (DDX3X, LAMP2, and RPS6KA3) were more highly expressed in females at Days 8 and 10 but more highly expressed in males at Day 12. Three X-linked genes (OFD1, KAL1, and LOC100525092) were more highly expressed in male embryos, although only at a low fold change of 1.2 to 1.4. Furthermore, expression of 8 transcripts located on autosomes was higher in females.

Embryos were flushed from cattle that had been superovulated and bred by AI. Blastocysts (63 male, 62 female) recovered between days 8.5 and 9.5 of pregnancy, were cultured individually. No differences were observed between males and females in either their developmental stage or quality at the beginning, during, and at the end of culture. Female embryos produced more IFN-tau than males by 24 hr (mean values, males: 16.6 +/- 3.7, females: 49.4 +/- 9.0 pg per embryo; P < 0.05) and 48 hr (male: 189.8 +/- 37, 1, female: 410.9 +/- 66.6 pg per embryo; P<0.05). However, the variability in IFN-tau production between individual blastocysts was so great that IFN-tau secretion is unlikely to be of value as a non-invasive means to predict embryo sex.

In all inbred strains male STS levels were higher than those of female STS levels and in the majority of strains tested male STS levels were nearly twice as high as female levels. Reciprocal crosses between C3H/HeH and the STS-deficient substrain, C3H/An, demonstrated that activities of the X- and Y-borne genes in males are essentially the same and this suggested that the lower STS level in females derives from X-inactivation of the locus.

In several species, growth factors including insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 have been shown to promote embryonic development by decreasing apoptosis and increasing cell proliferation. We hypothesized that sex-related differences in IGF-1 expression in equine embryos during the phase of maternal recognition of pregnancy might exist and thus contribute to preferential survival of embryos from either of both sexes under specific environmental conditions. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression of in vivo-produced equine embryos on different days of pregnancy (Day 8, N = 6; Day 10, N = 8; Day 12, N = 14) was analyzed. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression was evaluated by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The sex of the embryo was determined by detection of X-inactivation specific transcript (Xist) RNA and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome DNA. Embryos positive for Xist expression were classified as female, and Xist negative and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome positive embryos were classified as male. From 28 embryos tested, 15 (54%) showed positive Xist expression and were thus classified as female. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression was influenced by sex (P = 0.01) but not by day of pregnancy (relative expression of IGF-1 in relation to beta-actin, Day 8: male 5.1 +/- 2.1, female 11.4; Day 10: male 5.2 +/- 1.6, female 17.4 +/- 6.7; Day 12: male 2.6 +/- 0.3, female 11.6 +/- 2.4). Results demonstrate an increased expression of IGF-1 in female equine embryos. Sex-related influences on expression of the IGF system are probably related to a gradual X chromosome inactivation.

We used the methylation differences between males and females to predict XCI statuses in blood and found that 81% had the same XCI status as previously determined using expression data. Most genes (83%) showed the same XCI status across tissues (blood, fetal: muscle, kidney and nerual); however, the methylation of a subset of genes predicted different XCI statuses in different tissues. Using previously published expression data the effect of transcription on gene-body methylation was investigated and while X-linked introns of highly expressed genes were more methylated than the introns of lowly expressed genes, exonic methylation did not differ based on expression level. We conclude that the XCI status predicted using methylation of X-linked promoters with CpG islands was usually the same as determined by expression analysis and that 12% of X-linked genes examined show tissue-specific XCI whereby a gene has a different XCI status in at least one of the four tissues examined.

In the current study, the methylation patterns for portions of the amelogenin genes are tested, which are encoded on both the X- and Y-chromosome (AMGX and AMGY). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify portions of AMGX and AMGY from genomic DNA of carcinomas of the colon, lung, liver and kidney, as well as from matched normal somatic tissues. The amplification target included Alu I methylation sensitive restriction endonuclease sites as well as a 189 bp sequence which is present in AMGX but is absent in AMGY. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of AMGX and AMGY was successful using genomic DNA from both tumour and normal control tissue in 24 of the 26 cases. Pretreatment of genomic DNA with Alu I blocked amplification of AMGX in all cases from both normal tissue and tumour. This indicates that AMGX and AMGY undergo a non-random pattern of methylation in both normal tissues and in tumours, precluding their use as a marker of clonality. Methylation of Alu I sites in AMGY suggests that the amelogenin genes undergo dosage compensation, which raises the possibility that the expression of amelogenin is not restricted to the development of the tooth bud but may also play some other role in various tissues of the body.","Zvejnieks, P A Tellschow, S R Gudlaugsson, E G Markham, N Shroyer, K R 1 R55 CA60830-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

The role of the second X chromosome in the female sex is less clear. Many, possibly most, genes on the second X chromosome are inactivated by the lyonization mechanism. It is obvious, however, that part of the second X chromosome escapes complete inactivation at least during certain periods or in certain cells. Otherwise, there would be no difference between XO females and XX females or between XY males and XXY males. The origin of the ovary is independent from the second X. Ovaries develop at the same time both in normal XX females and in XO females. In the latter, however, ovarian degeneration begins towards the end of pregnancy. There are conspicuous effects of the second X on survival, growth and form. Less than 5% of XO embryos will survive to term. Those surviving are small for date babies with severely retarded postnatal growth and increased postnatal mortality. Neither a comparably high mortality nor growth retardation are seen in the autosomal recessive or possible X linked types of pure gonadal dysgenesis. They must, therefore, in some way be related to the lack of the second X. The better chances of survival of normal females as compared to males may in part be due to a similar mechanism. X linked recessive genes, though present in about twice as many males, are regularly manifested in males, but only exceptionally in females. This mechanism causes a higher mortality of some males rather than a generally higher mortality of the male. A quite impressive list of X linked conditions can be drawn up which may cause death between birth and early adult age.

One hint concerning etiological influences is the universally reported male excess (in the range of 4:1 to 10:1). Evidence suggests that genetic influences from the X chromosome play a crucial role in engendering this male vulnerability. In this review, we discuss three categories of genetic disease that highlight the importance of X-linked genes in the manifestation of an autistic phenotype: aneuploides (Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome), trinucleotide expansions (Fragile X syndrome) and nucleotide mutations (Rett Syndrome, Neuroligins 3 & 4, and SLC6A8). The lessons from these diseases include an understanding of autistic features as a broad phenotype rather than as a single clinical entity, the role of multiple genes either alone or in concert with the manifestation of autistic features, and the role of epigenetic factors such as imprinting and X-inactivation in the expression of disease severity. Better understanding of the clinical phenotypes of social cognition and the molecular neurogenetics of X-linked gene disorders will certainly provide additional tools for understanding autism in the years to come.","L358947578 2010-06-11","10.1093/scan/nsl028","MECP2 protein, human;methyl CpG binding protein 2;autism;child;cognitive defect;female;genetics;genotype;human;male;phenotype;point mutation;preschool child;psychomotor disorder;review;sex chromosome;sex difference;syndrome;X chromosome;X Chromosome;Autistic Disorder",NA,NA

After mass excision and isolation of plasmid DNA, approximately 4800 expressed sequence tags were determined and compared to existing databases. Few cDNAs were specifically expressed in the urogenital ridge, but one, designated GPBOX, encodes a 227-amino-acid homeobox protein that is first expressed at E10.5 in the embryo as well as in the extraembryonic tissues. The Gpbox gene is single copy in the mouse genome and is located on the X chromosome in close proximity to two other homeobox genes, Pem and Psx1. Within the embryo, its expression is limited to the gonad, and transcripts are not detected in adult tissues. Although comparable levels are initially present in both sexes, GPBOX transcripts accumulate faster in female germ cells and peak at E12.5 when they are present in fivefold greater abundance than in males. The persistence of GPBOX transcripts in female germ cells until E15.5 and their virtual disappearance in males by E13.5 suggest that Gpbox may play a role in mammalian oogenesis.

It has been stated that between 20 and 50% of women who are carriers may manifest some symptoms and recent evidence has suggested the differences in disease manifestations and relative rates of progression between men and women.

The Y chromosome is unique in males. Genes expressed in males on the Y chromosome that are associated with stroke may be important genetic contributors to the unique features of males with ischemic stroke, which would be helpful for explaining sex differences observed between men and women. Objective: We compared Y chromosome gene expression in males with ischemic stroke and male controls. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 40 male patients <= 3, 5, and 24 hours after ischemic stroke and from 41 male controls (July 2003 April 2007). RNA was isolated from blood and was processed using Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, California). Y chromosome genes differentially expressed between male patients with stroke and male control subjects were identified using an ANCOVA adjusted for age and batch. A P < 0.05 and a fold change >1.2 were considered significant. Results: Seven genes on the Y chromosome were differentially expressed in males with ischemic stroke compared with controls. Five of these genes (VAMP7, CSF2RA, SPRY3, DHRSX, and PLCXD1) are located on pseudoautosomal regions of the human Y chromosome. The other 2 genes (EIF1AY and DDX3Y) are located on the nonrecombining region of the human Y chromosome. The identified genes were associated with immunology, RNA metabolism, vesicle fusion, and angiogenesis. Conclusions: Specific genes on the Y chromosome are differentially expressed in blood after ischemic stroke. These genes provide insight into potential molecular contributors to sex differences in ischemic stroke. (Gend Med. 2012;9:68-75) (C) 2012 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

Many X-linked immune genes escape X inactivation showing biallelic expression in female immune cells, particularly in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs).

Sexually dimorphic genes were identified using two criteria: a >= 2-fold change and a P-value < 0.05. Only 12 out of 41,374 probes (0.03%) showed sexually dimorphic expression. For companson, pituitaries from 60-day-old female and male rats were analyzed, as this gland is known to display many sex-specific features. Indeed, almost 40 times more probes, i.e. 460 (1.1 %), displayed sexual dimorphism. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed 47 out of 48 microarray results from both tissues. Taking microarray and qRT-PCR data together, the expression of six genes (Prl, Eif2s3y, Gnrhr, Panic, Ddx3y, Akr1c6) was higher in the male SOC, whereas two genes were upregulated in the female SOC (LOC302172, Xist). Four of these genes are sex-chromosome linked (Eif2s3y, Ddx3y, LOC302172, Xist).

There is a need to continue examining neuro-immune-endocrine crosstalk in the context of sexual dimorphisms in chronic pain. Several phenomena in particular need to be further explored. In patients, autoantibodies to neural antigens have been associated with sensory pathway hyper-excitability, and the role of self-antigens released by damaged nerves remains to be defined. In addition, specific immune cells release pro-nociceptive cytokines that directly influence neural firing, while T lymphocytes activated by specific antigens secrete factors that either support nerve repair or exacerbate the damage. Modulating specific immune cell populations could therefore be a means to promote nerve recovery, with sex-specific outcomes. Understanding biological sex differences that maintain, or fail to maintain, neuroimmune homeostasis may inform the selection of sex-specific treatment regimens, improving chronic pain management by rebalancing neuroimmune feedback.

Prenatal stress is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, including early onset schizophrenia and autism. In our mouse model of early prenatal stress (EPS), stress exposure during the first week of gestation imparts long-term neurodevelopmental programming deficits in male offspring resulting in hypersensitivity to stress, cognitive impairments, and alterations in metabolic programming. The placenta, a fetally-derived organ reflecting fetal sex, acts as an arbitrator between the mother and fetus, providing necessary factors for early fetal neurodevelopment. Thus, sex differences in placental function may dramatically influence sex bias in vulnerability to prenatal insults. Methods and results: We previously identified the X-linked, stress-sensitive, nutrient sensor O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (OGT) as a placental biomarker of prenatal stress. OGT escapes X-inactivation in the placenta, providing females with increased expression. Placental-specific reduction of OGT recapitulates our EPS phenotype. Using ChIP-Seq, biochemistry, and RNA-Seq in mouse placentas with trophoblast-specific OGT reduction, we found that OGT determines genome-wide sex differences in H3K27me3 and gene expression in placental trophoblasts. Further, RNA-Seq of the embryonic hypothalamus revealed that reducing OGT in the female placenta masculinized the expression of key genes associated with hypothalamic development, suggesting that placental OGT contributes to sex differences in brain development. Conclusions: We hypothesize that female-biased epigenetic repression protects females from prenatal insults. These studies, aimed at elucidating the basic biological differences between male and female developmental programs, will bring us closer to fully understanding the etiology of sex-biased neurodevelopmental disorders.","L619372130 2017-11-28","10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.07.405","biological marker;biological product;endogenous compound;histone H3;n acetylglucosamine;animal experiment;biochemistry;brain development;chromatin immunoprecipitation;embryo;epigenetic repression;epigenetics;female;fetus;hypothalamus;male;mouse;nervous system malformation;nonhuman;nutrient;phenotype;placenta function;prenatal stress;sensor;sex difference;trophoblast;X chromosome inactivation;Pregnancy",NA,NA

These heterogametic females were initially thought to occur due to an extreme process of dosage compensation in which X inactivation was restricted to Xp and complemented by a deletion of Xq (Xx females). Later on, a C-banding analysis of A. mollis variant females showed that these specimens were in fact XY* sex reversed and not Xx females. The finding of positive testing for Zfy and Sry multiple-copy genes in Akodon males and heterogametic females confirmed the XY* assumption. At the present time, XY* sex reversed females have been found to exist in nine Akodon species. Akodon heterogametic females produce X and Y* oocytes, which upon sperm fertilization give rise to viable XX (female), XY* (female), and XY (male) embryos, and to non-viable Y*Y zygotes. Heterozygous females exhibit a better reproductive performance than XX females in order to compensate the Y*Y zygote wastage. XY* sex reversed females are assumed to occur due to a deficient Sry expression resulting in the development of ovaries instead of testes. Moreover, the appearance of Y* elements is a highly recurrent event. It is proposed that homo-zygosity for an autosomal or pseudoautosomal recessive mutation (s-) inhibits Sry expression giving rise to XY* embryos with ovary development. Location of the Y* chromosome in the female germ cell lineage produces an ovary-specific imprinting of the Sry* gene maintaining its defective expression through generations independently from the presence or absence of s- homozygosity. By escaping the ovary-specific methylation some Y* chromosomes turn back to normal Ys producing Y oocytes capable of generating normal male embryos when fertilized by an X sperm. Fluctuations in the rate of variant females in field populations and in laboratory colonies of Akodon depend on the balance between the appearance of new variant females (s-/s-, XY* specimens) and the extinction of sex reversed specimens due to imprinting escape.

For example, rapid cycling (RC) is more prevalent in females, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) is more prevalent in males. We hypothesize that X chromosome variants may be associated with sex-specific characteristics of BD. Few studies have explored the role of the X chromosome in BD, which is complicated by X chromosome inactivation (XCI). This process achieves ""dosage compensation"" for many X chromosome genes by silencing one of the two copies in females, and most statistical methods either ignore that XCI occurs or falsely assume that one copy is inactivated at all loci. We introduce new statistical methods that do not make these assumptions. METHODS: We investigated this hypothesis in 1001 BD patients from the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) and 957 BD patients from the Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder Biobank. We examined the association of over 14,000 X chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with sex-associated BD traits using two statistical approaches that account for whether a SNP may be undergoing or escaping XCI. In the ""XCI-informed approach,"" we fit a sex-adjusted logistic regression model assuming additive genetic effects where we coded the SNP either assuming one copy is expressed or two copies are expressed based on prior knowledge about which regions are inactivated. In the ""XCI-robust approach,"" we fit a logistic regression model with sex, SNP, and SNP-sex interaction effects that is flexible to whether the region is inactivated or escaping XCI. RESULTS: Using the ""XCI-informed approach,"" which considers only the main effect of SNP and does not allow the SNP effect to differ by sex, no significant associations were identified for any of the phenotypes. Using the ""XCI-robust approach,"" intergenic SNP rs5932307 was associated with BD (P = 8.3 Ã 10-8), with a stronger effect in females (odds ratio in males (ORM) = 1.13, odds ratio in females for a change of two allele copies (ORW2) = 3.86). CONCLUSION: X chromosome association studies should employ methods which account for its unique biology. Future work is needed to validate the identified associations with BD, to formally assess the performance of both approaches under different true genetic architectures, and to apply these approaches to study sex differences in other conditions.","L630139452 2019-12-18 2020-05-07","10.1186/s13293-019-0272-4","adult;bipolar disorder;female;genetics;genotype;human;male;middle aged;phenotype;sexual characteristics;single nucleotide polymorphism;statistical model;X chromosome;Bipolar Disorder;X Chromosome",NA,NA

In the absence of T regulatory cells, activated CD4+ T cells instigate multi-organ damage resulting in type 1 diabetes, enteropathy, eczema, hypothyroidism, and other autoimmune disorders. While effective therapies are currently limited, studies in the scurfy mouse are revealing aspects of pathophysiology and genetics that will lead to novel approaches for treating IPEX and other autoimmune disorders.

This ratio is lower than the estimated sex ratio at fertilization which ranges from 1.07 to 1.70 depending on the figures of sex ratio at birth and differential embryo/fetal mortality rates taken into account to perform these estimations. Likewise, little is known about the sex ratio at implantation in natural and assisted-reproduction-treatment (ART) cycles. In this bioessay, we aim to estimate the sex ratio at fertilization and implantation using data from embryos generated by standard in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycles. Thereafter, we compare sex ratios at implantation and birth in cleavage- and blastocyst-stage-transfer cycles to propose molecular mechanisms accounting for differences in post-implantation male and female mortality and thereby variations in sex ratios at birth in ART cycles. METHODS: A literature review based on publications up to December 2013 identified by PubMed database searches. RESULTS: Sex ratio at both fertilization and implantation is estimated to be between 1.29 and 1.50 in IVF cycles and 1.07 in ICSI cycles. Compared with the estimated sex ratio at implantation, sex ratio at birth is lower in IVF cycles (1.03 after cleavage-stage transfer and 1.25 after blastocyst-stage transfer) but similar and close to unity in ICSI cycles (0.95 after cleavage-stage transfer and 1.04 after blastocyst-stage transfer). CONCLUSIONS: In-vitro-culture-induced precocious X-chromosome inactivation together with ICSI-induced decrease in number of trophectoderm cells in female blastocysts may account for preferential female mortality at early post-implantation stages and thereby variations in sex ratios at birth in ART cycles.","1477-7827 TarÃ­n, Juan J GarcÃ­a-PÃ©rez, Miguel A Hermenegildo, Carlos Cano, Antonio Comparative Study Journal Article Review England 2014/06/25 Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2014 Jun 23;12:56. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-12-56.","10.1186/1477-7827-12-56","Animals;Blastocyst/cytology/pathology;Cleavage Stage, Ovum/cytology/pathology/transplantation;*Ectogenesis;Embryo Culture Techniques;Embryo Implantation;Embryo Loss/*etiology/pathology;Embryo Transfer/adverse effects;*Embryonic Development;Female;Fertilization in Vitro/*adverse effects;Humans;Infertility, Female/pathology/therapy;Infertility, Male;Live Birth;Male;Pregnancy;Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*adverse effects;*Sex Ratio;X Chromosome Inactivation;Sex Ratio;Self-Fertilization",NA,NA

Male-to-female transsexuals have a significant excess of maternal aunts vs. uncles. No differences from the expected parity were found for female-to-male transsexuals or on the paternal side. A posited explanation for these findings invokes X inactivation and genes on the X chromosome that escape inactivation but may be imprinted. Our hypothesis incorporates the known familial traits in the families of homosexuals and transsexuals by way of retention of the grand parental epigenotype on the X chromosome. Generation one would be characterized by a failure to erase the paternal imprints on the paternal X chromosome. Daughters of this second generation would produce sons that are XpY and XmY. Since XpY expresses Xist, the X chromosome is silenced and half of the sons are lost at the earliest stages of pregnancy because of the normal requirement for paternal X expression in extra-embryonic tissues. Females survive by virtue of inheriting two X chromosomes, and therefore the possibility of X chromosome counting and choice during embryonic development. In generation three, sons inheriting the paternal X after its second passage through the female germline survive, but half would inherit the feminizing Xp imprinted genes.

Evidences suggest that epigenetic differences produced by the presence of one or two X-chromosomes are the principal cause of the male and female pre-implantation differences, and we put forward the possible role of these early sex differences to control sex ratio of the offspring under different environmental conditions in Nature. By following the differences between male and female early embryos not only may be possible to manipulate sex ratio in farm animals, we can also gain further insight into aspects of early embryo development, X inactivation, and epigenetic and genetic processes related with early development that may have a long-term effect on the offspring.

One early and irreversible process affecting gene expression, which can create differences within pairs of female monozygotic twins, is X inactivation - one twin can express mainly paternally-received genes on the X chromosome while the other twin expresses mainly maternally-received genes. It follows that non-identical X chromosome expression may cause female monozygotic twins to correlate less strongly than male monozygotic twins on complex behavioural traits affected by X-linked loci. We tested this hypothesis using data from around 4000 same-sex twin pairs on 9 social, behavioural and cognitive measures at ages 2, 3 and 4. Consistent with our hypothesis, monozygotic males were generally more similar than monozygotic females. Three of four significant differences were in traits showing higher correlations in males than females, and these traits - prosocial behaviour, peer problems, and verbal ability - have all been proposed previously in the literature as being influenced by genes on the X chromosome. Interestingly, dizygotic twins showed the reverse pattern of correlations for similar variables, which is also consistent with the X inactivation hypothesis; taken together, then, our monozygotic and dizygotic results suggest the presence of quantitative trait loci on the X chromosome.","Loat, Caroline S Asbury, Kathryn Galsworthy, Michael J Plomin, Robert Craig, Ian W Comparative Study Journal Article Twin Study Australia 2004/04/01 Twin Res. 2004 Feb;7(1):54-61. doi: 10.1375/13690520460741444.","10.1375/13690520460741444","*Behavior;Child, Preschool;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Female;Humans;Male;Sex Factors;Twins, Monozygotic/*genetics;Twins",NA,NA

Recent findings Recent studies investigating the origins of sex bias in autoimmune disease have revealed an extensive and interconnected network of genetic, hormonal, microbial, and environmental influences. Investigation of sex hormones has moved beyond profiling the effects of hormones on activity and prevalence of immune cell types to defining the specific immunity-related genes driving these changes. Deeper examination of the genetic content of the X and Y chromosomes and genetic escapees of X chromosome inactivation has revealed some key drivers of female-biased autoimmunity. Animal studies are offering further insights into the connections among microbiota, particularly that of the gut, and the immune system.

Both genetic and hormonal factors are involved in this phenomenon. The relation between puberty and F: M ratio in CAT has never been evaluated. Methods: The F: M ratio of 133 children with CAT (group A, age at diagnosis 2.4-17.7 years) was compared with that of 113 adult CAT patients (group B, age at diagnosis 21-79 years). Group A included 64 prepubertal (aged 2.4-13.2 years, group A1) and 69 pubertal (aged 9.2-17.4, group A2) children. Results: The F: M ratio in group A was 3.0, which is significantly (p < 0.001) lower than that (10.3) found in group B patients. The F: M ratio of group A1 prepubertal children was lower (1.6) and significantly different from that of pubertal (6.7, p < 0.01) and adult patients (10.3, p < 0.0001). This phenomenon was more evident in hypothyroid as compared to euthyroid CAT. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that female predominance of CAT strongly increases during puberty, suggesting a major role for sex hormones in this phenomenon. Further studies are needed to clarify this point. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

Over 4,000 predicted regulatory elements (7.2%) showed reproducible variation in accessibility between individuals. Gender was the most significant attributable source of variation. ATAC-seq revealed previously undescribed elements that escape X chromosome inactivation and predicted gender-specific gene regulatory networks across autosomes, which coordinately affect genes with immune function. Noisy regulatory elements with personal variation in accessibility are significantly enriched for autoimmune disease loci. Over one third of regulome variation lacked genetic variation in cis, suggesting contributions from environmental or epigenetic factors. These results refine concepts of human individuality and provide a foundational reference for comparing disease-associated regulomes.","L605461472 2015-08-06 2015-08-12","10.1016/j.cels.2015.06.003","transposase;article;autoimmune disease;autoimmunity;autosome;cancer patient;CD4+ T lymphocyte;chromatin;cis isomer;controlled study;environmental factor;epigenetics;female;gene locus;gene regulatory network;genetic variability;human;human cell;individuality;male;nucleotide sequence;priority journal;regulatory sequence;sex difference;T lymphocyte activation;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans",NA,NA

The aim of this study was to determine if altered glucose metabolism, through glucose supplementation and/or uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation with 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), affected embryo development. Bovine blastocyst development, sex, and IFNT production were examined in embryos cultured in the presence or absence of glucose (0, 1.5, 4mM) with or without exposure to DNP (0, 10, 100M) between Days 5 and 8 post-fertilization. The absence or presence of high (4mM) glucose reduced blastocyst development and favored the development of male embryos (P<0.001). DNP at 10M had no effect, whereas 100M had a negative impact on blastocyst development. Notably, in the presence or even absence of glucose, supplementation with 10M DNP further skewed the sex ratio toward males (P<0.05). Sexually dimorphic IFNT production was maintained in these conditions, although total production was reduced in the presence of high glucose and DNP, irrespective of embryo sex. These data suggest that the pentose phosphate pathway can modulate embryonic sex ratio and development. Therefore, bovine embryo culture should be undertaken in a low glucose (<2.5mM) medium to minimize potential embryonic stress, as higher concentrations have sexually dimorphic effects on development and an embryo's ability to signal to the maternal reproductive tract.

Evidently, different sex-determining systems (and sex chromosome pairs) have evolved independently in different vertebrate lineages. Homology shared by Xs and Ys (and Zs and Ws) within species demonstrates that differentiated sex chromosomes were once homologous, and that the sex-specific non-recombining Y (or W) was progressively degraded. Consequently, genes are left in single copy in the heterogametic sex, which results in an imbalance of the dosage of genes on the sex chromosomes between the sexes, and also relative to the autosomes. Dosage compensation has evolved in diverse species to compensate for these dose differences, with the stringency of compensation apparently differing greatly between lineages, perhaps reflecting the concentration of genes on the original autosome pair that required dosage compensation. We discuss the organization and evolution of amniote sex chromosomes, and hypothesize that dosage insensitivity might predispose an autosome to evolving function as a sex chromosome.

This higher IFNÎ± production in females has been suggested to contribute to sex-specific differences in the manifestations of infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE). Factors underlying these sex dimorphisms in immunity include genetics, sex hormones and exposure to environmental factors. Genetic differences between women and men are mainly due to a different distribution of chromosomes, with females possessing two X chromosomes. TLR7 escapes X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in some female pDCs, leading to biallelic expression of TLR7 in those cells. The functional consequences of TLR7 escape from XCI in pDCs remain unknown. Question: The aim of this project was to investigate on the single cell level whether pDCs with escape from XCI in TLR7 have a superior capacity of transcribing IFNÎ± mRNA. Methods: Healthy female donors were typed for heterozygosity of the TLR7 SNP rs3853839. Freshly isolated PBMCs of heterozygous females were collected and stimulated with the TLR7/8 agonist CL097. Subsequently pDCs were isolated via FACS and cDNA of single pDCs was obtained using the Fluidigm C1 technology. The expression of mRNA with or without the SNP enabled determination of mono- or biallelic expression pattern of TLR7 within the single pDC. In the same pDCs, mRNA expression levels of TLR7, IFNÎ± subtypes and other genes were assessed via qPCR. Results and Conclusion: Studies in three females heterozygous for TLR7 SNP rs3853839 showed that 19 - 37% of pDCs display biallelic expression of TLR7, using data from 176 single cells. The levels of TLR7 mRNA were higher in cells with biallelic compared to monoallelic TLR7 expression. In addition, multiple IFNÎ± mRNA subtypes were expressed at higher levels in pDCs with biallelic compared to monoallelic expression of TLR7 following CL097 stimulation. These data demonstrate that on the single cell level escape from XCI can contribute to stronger IFNÎ± transcription by female pDCs.","L631551923 2020-04-28","10.1002/eji.201970300","alpha interferon;complementary DNA;endogenous compound;messenger RNA;toll like receptor 7;adult;allele;case report;cell level;clinical article;conference abstract;female;flow cytometry;genetic association;genetic difference;genetic transcription;heterozygosity;human;human cell;male;mRNA expression level;peripheral blood mononuclear cell;plasmacytoid dendritic cell;protein expression;single nucleotide polymorphism;X chromosome inactivation;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;X Chromosome",NA,NA

In placental mammals, an ancient difference between males and females that may make an important contribution to GMV is the different pattern of activation of X chromosomes across cells in females (mosaic inactivation of one the two X chromosomes across cells) vs males (consistent activation of a single X chromosome in all cells). In the current study, variability in hearing thresholds was examined for human listeners with thresholds within the normal range. Initial analyses compared variability in thresholds across males vs. across females. If greater across-male than across-female variability was present, and if these differences in variability related to the different patterns X-chromosome activation in males vs. females, it was expected that correlations between related measures within a given subject (e.g., hearing thresholds at given frequency in the two ears) would be greater in males than females. METHODS: Hearing thresholds at audiometric test frequencies (500-6000 or 500-8000Â Hz) were extracted from two datasets representing more than 8500 listeners with normal hearing (4590 males, 4376 females). Separate data analyses were carried out on each dataset to compare: (1) relative variability in hearing thresholds across males vs. across females at each test frequency; (2) correlations between both across-ear and within-ear hearing thresholds withinÂ  males vs. withinÂ  females, and (3) mean thresholds for females vs. males at each frequency. RESULTS: A consistent pattern of GMV in hearing thresholds was seen across frequencies in both datasets. In addition, both across-ear and within-ear correlations between thresholds were consistently greater in males than females. Previous studies have frequently reported lower mean thresholds for females than males for listeners with normal hearing. One of the datasets replicated this result, showing a clear and consistent pattern of lower mean thresholds for females. The second data set did not show clear evidence of this female advantage. CONCLUSIONS: Hearing thresholds showed clear evidence of greater variability across males than across females and higher correlations across related threshold measures within males than within females.

S. and Nanjundiah, V.","",NA,NA,NA,"We explore three possible pathways for the evolution of genomic imprinting. (1) Imprinting may be advantageous in itself when imprinted and unimprinted alleles of a locus confer different phenotypes. If a segment of DNA is imprinted in the gametes of one sex but not in those of the other, it might lead to effects correlated with sexual dimorphism. More fundamentally, in certain organisms, sex determination might have evolved because of imprinting. When imprinting leads to chromosome elimination or inactivation and occurs in some embryos but not in others, two classes of embryos, differing in the number of functional gene copies, would result. A model for sex determination based on inequality in the actual or effective copy-number of particular noncoding, regulatory sequences of DNA has been proposed (Chandra, Proc. natn. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82. 1165-1169 and 6947-6949, 1985). Maternal control of offspring sex is another possible consequence of imprinting; this would indicate a potential role for imprinting in sex ratio evolution. (2) Genes responsible for imprinting may have pleiotropic effects and they may have been selected for reasons other than their imprinting ability. Lack of evidence precludes further consideration of this possibility. (3) Imprinting could have co-evolved with other traits. For instance, gamete-specific imprinting could lead to a lowered fitness of androgenetic or gynogenetic diploids relative to the fitness of 'normal' diploids. This in turn would reinforce the evolution of anisogamy. The reversibility of imprinting raises the possibility of occasional incomplete or improper erasure. If the site of imprinting is the egg - as appears to be the case with the human X (Chandra and Brown, Nature 253. 165-168, 1975)- either improper imprinting or improper erasure could lead to unusual patterns of inheritance (as in the fragile-X syndrome) or fitness effects skipping generations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 14 Total Times Cited: 16 Cited Reference Count: 39","","x-inactivation;mealybugs;evolution of sex;anisogamy;mammalian x-chromosome;methylation;origin;mice;inactivation;inheritance;gamete;Genomics;Genome",NA,NA

By contrast, female-typical psychosexual characteristics may actually be organized under the influence of estradiol during a specific prepubertal period. The sexual differentiation of the human brain also seems to proceed predominantly under the influence of sex hormones. Recent studies using magnetic resonance imaging have shown that several sexually differentiated aspects of brain structure and function are female-typical in women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46 XY karyotype but a female phenotype due to complete androgen resistance, suggesting that these sex differences most likely reflect androgen action, although feminizing effects of estrogens or female-typical socialization cannot be ruled out. By contrast, some male-typical neural characteristics were also observed in women with CAIS suggesting direct effects of sex chromosome genes in the sexual differentiation of the human brain. In conclusion, the sexual differentiation of the human brain is most likely a multifactorial process including both sex hormone and sex chromosome effects, acting in parallel or in combination.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 15 Total Times Cited: 15 Cited Reference Count: 134","10.1007/7854_2018_70 10.1007/978-3-030-38720-4","Androgens;Brain function;Brain structure;Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome;Estrogens;Magnetic resonance imaging;Sex differences;Sexual development;ANDROGEN INSENSITIVITY SYNDROME;CONGENITAL ADRENAL-HYPERPLASIA;TESTICULAR FEMINIZING SYNDROME;WHITE-MATTER MICROSTRUCTURE;X-INACTIVATION PROFILE;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Sex Chromosomes;Brain",NA,NA

A.","",NA,NA,NA,"Comparisons of the sex chromosome systems in birds and mammals are widening our view and deepening our understanding of vertebrate sex chromosome organization, function, and evolution. Birds have a very conserved ZW system of sex determination in which males have two copies of a large, gene-rich Z chromosome, and females have a single Z and a female-specific W chromosome. The avian ZW system is quite the reverse of the well-studied mammalian XY chromosome system, and evolved independently from different autosomal blocs. Despite the different gene content of mammal and bird sex chromosomes, there are many parallels. Genes on the bird Z and the mammal X have both undergone selection for male-advantage functions, and there has been amplification of male-advantage genes and accumulation of LINEs. The bird W and mammal Y have both undergone extensive degradation, but some birds retain early stages and some mammals terminal stages of the process, suggesting that the process is more advanced in mammals. Different sex-determining genes, DMRT1 and SRY, define the ZW and XY systems, but DMRT1 is involved in downstream events in mammals. Birds show strong cell autonomous specification of somatic sex differences in ZZ and ZW tissue, but there is growing evidence for direct X chromosome effects on sexual phenotype in mammals. Dosage compensation in birds appears to be phenotypically and molecularly quite different from X inactivation, being partial and gene-specific, but both systems use tools from the same molecular toolbox and there are some signs that galliform birds represent an early stage in the evolution of a coordinated system.","1573-6849 Graves, Jennifer A Marshall Journal Article Review Netherlands 2014/03/07 Chromosome Res. 2014 Apr;22(1):45-57. doi: 10.1007/s10577-014-9409-9.","10.1007/s10577-014-9409-9","Animals;Birds/*genetics;Dosage Compensation, Genetic/*genetics;*Evolution, Molecular;Female;In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence;Male;*Phenotype;*Sex;Sex Chromosomes/*genetics;Sex Determination Processes/*genetics;Species Specificity;Transcription Factors/genetics;Sex Chromosomes;Genomics;Genome",NA,NA

Recently, we successfully identified a strong candidate gene at the top of the sex determination cascade in B. mori. This gene was termed Feminizer (Fem) and revealed to be a source of Fem-piRNA. Further, we found that B. mori doublesex (Bmdsx) splicing was markedly altered to produce the male-type isoform when a Fem-piRNA inhibitor was injected into ZW embryos. Moreover, knockdown of Masculinizer (Masc), a Fem-piRNA target gene, altered to produce the female-type isoform of Bmdsx in male embryos. However, it remains unclear as to whether Masc directly regulates the sex-specific expression of Bmdsx. In previous studies, we determined that the male-specific isoform of the Bombyx homolog of IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (Imp(M)) was involved in the male-specific splicing of Bmdsx. In an attempt to clarify the genetic relationship between Fem, Masc, Imp(M), and Bmdsx, knockdown experiments were performed. Knockdown of Fem shifted into male-type Bmdsx, Imp(M) and Masc in female embryos. Knockdown of Masc led to the production of the female-type Bmdsx and a dramatic reduction in Imp(M) expression in male embryos. Knockdown of ImpM shifted Bmdsx splice mode from the male-type into the female-type. Our results suggest that: (1) Fem reduces Masc expression, (2) Masc dramatically induces Imp(M) expression, and (3) Imp(M) shifting Bmdsx splice mode from the female-type into the male-type.

This variation is expected to affect the laboratory detection of the hemophilia A (HA) heterozygotes in addition to the X-inactivation-dependent mosaicism and the type of deficient mutant present in a given pedigree. The Sardinian pedigrees yielded 13 new cases of nonrecombinants between the loci for HA and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), as well as four nonrecombinants between HA and Deutan color blindness. These findings bring to a total of 58 the number of scorable sibs and nonrecombinants thus far known for the linkage HA-G6PD. From such a figure it has been possible to infer that the 90% upper limit of meiotic recombination between the two loci is below 4%, thus justifying the application of the 'linkage diagnostic test' for the detection of HA heterozygotes and the prenatal diagnosis of the hemophilic fetuses in families that segregate at both loci. In three out of the five HA pedigrees of our series that segregate also for G6PD or Deutan color blindness, the observed segregation of the combined phenotypes can be best explained by assuming the occurrence of a fresh mutation in the maternal grandfather. Such a finding points out the opportunity to reevaluate Haldane's hypothesis of a possible higher incidence of X-linked mutations in the human male. It is anticipated that each of the issues addressed by the present study will be amenable to experimental verification as soon as suitable molecular probes become available to screen for common multiallelic DNA polymorphisms in the subtelomeric region of the X-chromosome long arm.","L14192766 1984-04-12","","blood clotting factor 8;glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase;blood and hemopoietic system;blood level;carrier;clinical article;color blindness;congenital disorder;diagnosis;epidemiology;genetic recombination;hemophilia;heredity;heterozygote detection;human;multiple allele;mutation rate;pedigree;phenotype;Sardinia;sex;sex difference;visual system;Factor XI Deficiency;Hemophilia A;Alleles;Italy;Hemophilia B;Mutation",NA,NA

Moreover, in the small number of studies in which sex is reported, most of those studies use male cells. The observation that cells from males and females are inherently different is becoming increasingly clear - either due to acquired differences from hormones and other factors or due to intrinsic differences in genotype (XX or XY). Because of the likely contribution of cellular sex differences in cardiac health and disease, here, we explore differences in mammalian male and female cells in the heart, including the less-studied non-myocyte cell populations. We discuss how the heart's microenvironment impacts male and female cellular phenotypes and vice versa, including how secretory profiles are dependent on cellular sex, and how hormones contribute to sexually dimorphic phenotypes and cellular functions. Intracellular mechanisms that contribute to sex differences, including gene expression and epigenetic remodeling, are also described. Recent single-cell sequencing studies have revealed unexpected sex differences in the composition of cell types in the heart which we discuss.

Studies of sex hormone function in the immune system are of obvious importance; however, it seems likely that many other types of sex-related genetic and immunological differences will contribute to SLE. In this review, we will focus on recent work in sex-related differences in cytokine pathways and genetics of these pathways as they relate to SLE pathogenesis.

Coccids show sex-specific heterochromatization of an entire set of chromosomes and transcriptional silencing of all the paternally contributed chromosomes in males. Thus, genomic imprinting and the resultant differential regulation operate on 50% of the genome in contrast to the single X chromosome in female mammals. A significant insight into the phenomenon of genomic imprinting has come from very elegant cytological analysis of the coccid system. Recently, efforts have been made to dissect out at the molecular level the phenomenon of genomic imprinting in these insects. The present review summarizes both of these aspects.

Following X inactivation in females, the Y chromosome is the major genetic difference between sexes. In this study, we used a male embryonic stem cell line (Royan H6) to identify the potential role of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) during spontaneous differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs) as a model of early embryonic development. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, RH6 cells were cultured on inactivated feeder layers and Matrigel. In a dynamic suspension system, aggregates were generated in the same size and were spontaneously differentiated into EBs. During differentiation, expression patterns of specific markers for three germ layers were compared with MSY genes. Results: Spontaneous differentiation was determined by downregulation of pluripotent markers and upregulation of fourteen differentiation markers. Upregulation of the ectoderm markers was observed on days 4 and 16, whereas mesoderm markers were upregulated on the 8th day and endodermic markers on days 12-16. Mesoderm markers correlated with 8 MSY genes namely DDX3Y, RPS4Y1, KDM5D, TBL1Y, BCORP1, PRY, DAZ, and AMELY, which were classified as a mesoderm cluster. Endoderm markers were co-expressed with 7 MSY genes, i.e. ZFY, TSPY, PRORY, VCY, EIF1AY, USP9Y, and RPKY, which were grouped as an endoderm cluster. Finally, the ectoderm markers correlated with TXLNGY, NLGN4Y, PCDH11Y, TMSB4Y, UTY, RBMY1, and HSFY genes of the MSY, which were categorized as an ectoderm cluster. In contrast, 2 MSY genes, SRY and TGIF2LY, were more highly expressed in RH6 cells compared to EBs. Conclusion: We found a significant correlation between spontaneous differentiation and upregulation of specific MSY genes. The expression alterations of MSY genes implied the potential responsibility of their gene co-expression clusters for EB differentiation. We suggest that these genes may play important roles in early embryonic development.","L2011891664 2021-05-27 2021-08-20","10.22074/cellj.2021.7145","polymerase chain reaction system;amely gene;article;bcorp1 gene;cell differentiation;daz gene;ddx3y gene;down regulation;ectoderm;eif1ay gene;embryo;embryo development;embryoid body;endoderm;feeder cell;gene;gene expression;genetic marker;hsfy gene;human;human cell;human embryonic stem cell;in vitro study;in vivo study;kdm5d gene;male;mesoderm;nlgn4y gene;pcdh11y gene;prory gene;pry gene;rbmy1 gene;rpky gene;rps4y1 gene;SRY gene;tbl1y gene;tgif2ly gene;tmsb4y gene;tspy gene;txlngy gene;upregulation;usp9y gene;uty gene;vcy gene;Y chromosome;zfy gene;Humanities;Humanism;Humans",NA,NA

PALP activity was very low in freshly isolated cytotrophoblasts (about 5% of placental tissue), and no significant difference between female and male cells was detectable. Within 90 h in culture, PALP activity increased in all preparations about 2- to 4-fold. G6PD activity in freshly isolated cytotrophoblasts showed great variation among preparations, and no significant difference between female and male cells was detectable. In both male and female cells the activity declined to about 50% of initial activity during cultivation. We conclude that human cytotrophoblasts in primary culture show a sex-specific regulation of STS activity, perhaps as a unique feature of the STS gene. The cytotrophoblast system may offer a new possibility to study the regulation of STS gene expression. Copyright (C) 2000 S.

Its main role is to facilitate gene expression through removal of the repressive H3K27me3 mark, with evidence of some additional histone demethylase-independent functions. KDM6A mutations have been implicated in congenital disorders such as Kabuki Syndrome, as well as in sex differences in cancer. METHODS: Kdm6a was knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in F1 male and female mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) derived from reciprocal crosses between C57BL6 x Mus castaneus. Diploid and allelic RNA-seq analyses were done to compare gene expression between wild-type and Kdm6a knockout (KO) clones. The effects of Kdm6a KO on sex-biased gene expression were investigated by comparing gene expression between male and female ES cells. Changes in H3K27me3 enrichment and chromatin accessibility at promoter regions of genes with expression changes were characterized by ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq followed by diploid and allelic analyses. RESULTS: We report that Kdm6a KO in male and female embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from F1 hybrid mice cause extensive gene dysregulation, disruption of sex biases, and specific parental allele effects. Among the dysregulated genes are candidate genes that may explain abnormal developmental features of Kabuki syndrome caused by KDM6A mutations in human. Strikingly, Kdm6a knockouts result in a decrease in sex-biased expression and in preferential downregulation of the maternal alleles of a number of genes. Most promoters of dysregulated genes show concordant epigenetic changes including gain of H3K27me3 and loss of chromatin accessibility, but there was less concordance when considering allelic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals new sex-related roles of KDM6A in the regulation of developmental genes, the maintenance of sex-biased gene expression, and the differential expression of parental alleles.","L638567147 2022-08-01 2022-08-03","10.1186/s13293-022-00452-0","histone;histone demethylase;allele;animal;chromatin;face;female;genetics;hematologic disease;human;male;metabolism;mouse;multiple malformation syndrome;vestibular disorder;Genes, Regulator;Alleles",NA,NA

In many organisms, dosage compensation has thus evolved to equalize sex-linked gene expression in males and females. In mammals this is achieved by X chromosome inactivation and in flies and worms by up- or down-regulation of X-linked expression, respectively. While otherwise widespread in systems with heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the case of dosage compensation in birds (males ZZ, females ZW) remains an unsolved enigma. RESULTS: Here, we use a microarray approach to show that male chicken embryos generally express higher levels of Z-linked genes than female birds, both in soma and in gonads. The distribution of male-to-female fold-change values for Z chromosome genes is wide and has a mean of 1.4-1.6, which is consistent with absence of dosage compensation and sex-specific feedback regulation of gene expression at individual loci. Intriguingly, without global dosage compensation, the female chicken has significantly lower expression levels of Z-linked compared to autosomal genes, which is not the case in male birds. CONCLUSION: The pronounced sex difference in gene expression is likely to contribute to sexual dimorphism among birds, and potentially has implication to avian sex determination. Importantly, this report, together with a recent study of sex-biased expression in somatic tissue of chicken, demonstrates the first example of an organism with a lack of global dosage compensation, providing an unexpected case of a viable system with large-scale imbalance in gene expression between sexes.","1741-7007 Ellegren, Hans Hultin-Rosenberg, Lina BrunstrÃ¶m, BjÃ¶rn Dencker, Lennart Kultima, Kim Scholz, Birger Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't England 2007/09/22 BMC Biol. 2007 Sep 20;5:40. doi: 10.1186/1741-7007-5-40.","10.1186/1741-7007-5-40","Animals;Chick Embryo;Chickens/*genetics;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Female;*Gene Expression;*Genes, X-Linked;Male;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Sex Characteristics;Socioeconomic Factors;Chickens",NA,NA

Evidence shows that many sex-specific diseases have their basis in X chromosome biology. While female schizophrenia patients often have a delayed age of disease onset and clinical phenotypes that are different from those of males, it is unknown whether the sex differences in schizophrenia are associated with X-linked gene dosage and the choice of X chromosome silencing in female cells. Previous studies demonstrated that sex chromosome aneuploidies may be related to the pathogeneses of some psychiatric diseases. Here, we examined the changes in skewed XCI in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: A total of 109 female schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and 80 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (CNTLs) were included in this study. We evaluated clinical features including disease onset age, disease duration, clinical symptoms by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and antipsychotic treatment dosages. The XCI skewing patterns were analyzed by the methylation profile of the HUMARA gene found in DNA isolated from SCZ patient and CNTL leukocytes in the three age groups. RESULTS: First, we found that the frequency of skewed XCI in SCZ patients was 4 times more than that in the age- and sex-matched CNTLs (p < 0.01). Second, we found an earlier onset of severe XCI skewing in the SCZ patients than in CNTLs. Third, we demonstrated a close relationship between the severity of skewed XCI and schizophrenic symptoms (PANSS score â¥ 90) as well as the age of disease onset. Fourth, we demonstrated that the skewed XCI in SCZ patients was not transmitted from the patients' mothers. LIMITATIONS: The XCI skewing pattern might differ depending on tissues or organs. Although this is the first study to explore skewed XCI in SCZ, in the future, samples from different tissues or cells in SCZ patients might be important for understanding the impact of skewed XCI in this disease. CONCLUSION: Our study, for the first time, investigated skewed XCI in female SCZ patients and presented a potential mechanism for the sex differences in SCZ. Our data also suggested that XCI might be a potential target for the development of female-specific interventions for SCZ.","L632387448 2020-07-28","10.1186/s13293-020-00315-6","adolescent;adult;aged;aging;case control study;child;female;genetic predisposition;genetics;human;middle aged;schizophrenia;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;young adult;Schizophrenia;X Chromosome",NA,NA

Conversely, environmental conditions experienced in early life can dramatically influence neonatal and adult biology, which may result in detrimental long-term effects. Several studies have shown that small size at birth, which is associated with a greater risk of metabolic syndrome, is largely determined before the formation of the blastocysts because 70%-80% of variation in bodyweight at birth has neither a genetic nor environmental component. In addition, it has been reported that adult bodyweight is programmed by energy-dependent process during the pronuclear stage in the mouse. Although the early embryo has a high developmental plasticity and adapts and survives to adverse environmental conditions, this adaptation may have adverse consequences and there is strong evidence that in vitro culture can be a risk factor for abnormal fetal outcomes in animals systems, with growing data suggesting that a similar link may be apparent for humans. In this context, male and female preimplantation embryos display sex-specific transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, which, in the case of bovine blastocysts, expands to one-third of the transcripts detected through microarray analysis. This sex-specific bias may convert the otherwise buffered stochastic variability in developmental networks in a sex-determined response to the environmental hazard. It has been widely reported that environment can affect preimplantation development in a sex-specific manner, resulting in either a short-term sex ratio adjustment or in long-term sex-specific effects on adult health. The present article reviews current knowledge about the natural phenotypic variation caused by epigenetic mechanisms and the mechanisms modulating sex-specific changes in phenotype during early embryo development resulting in sex ratio adjustments or detrimental sex-specific consequences for adult health. Understanding the natural embryo sexual dimorphism for programming trajectories will help understand the early mechanisms of response to environmental insults.

Although many studies have demonstrated the role of sex hormones in immune response modulation, recent clinical data revealed significant sex differences in inflammatory markers in prepubertal children, suggesting a genetic contribution. We studied several immune functions depending on X-linked genes in healthy adults of both sexes: the respiratory burst of purified neutrophils, the CD99 and CD11b expression of stimulated leukocytes as markers of adhesion and diapedesis, and the production of inflammatory cytokines in whole blood after incubation with lipopolysaccharide for 24 h. The percentage of monocytes expressing CD99 was higher in men than in women, thus confirming the higher CD99 expression reported in males using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, we observed a higher tumor necrosis factor alpha and tendency toward higher interleukin (IL) 6 production in men after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. These differences may contribute to the higher mortality reported in men with septic shock. Tumor necrosis factor a production significantly correlated with monocyte count, with men having a higher monocyte count than women. When cytokine levels were normalized to monocyte counts, a higher IL-8 production was found in women, which may explain the higher neutrophil count observed in girls with acute inflammatory diseases, because IL-8 is a major neutrophil chemoattractant. These sex differences regarding the activation of certain X-linked genes involved in innate immunity confirm our clinical observations, thus supporting the role of sex chromosomes in inflammatory response.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 40 Total Times Cited: 40 Cited Reference Count: 35","10.1097/SHK.0b013e3182571e46","Sex;inflammation;Toll-like receptor;endotoxin;diapedesis;tumor necrosis factor alpha;interleukin 8;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;SEVERELY BURNED CHILDREN;GENDER-DIFFERENCES;CELLULAR MOSAICISM;AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE;THERMAL BURNS;SEPSIS;MORTALITY;TRAUMA;SHOCK;Sex Characteristics;Cytokines;Lipopolysaccharides",NA,NA

Gonadal hormones are a major determinant of these sex differences. However, sex differences in body size and composition are evident prior to exposure to gonadal hormones, providing evidence for gonadal-independent contributions attributable to the XX or XY sex chromosome complement. Large-scale genetic studies have revealed male/female differences in the genetic architecture of adipose tissue amount and anatomical distribution. However, these studies have typically neglected the X and Y chromosomes. Scope of the review: Here we discuss how the sex chromosome complement may influence obesity, lipid levels, and inflammation. Human sex chromosome anomalies such as Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), as well as mouse models with engineered alterations in sex chromosome complement, support an important role for sex chromosomes in obesity and metabolism. In particular, the Four Core Genotypes mouse modelâconsisting of XX mice with either ovaries or testes, and XY mice with either ovaries or testesâhas revealed an effect of X chromosome dosage on adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation irrespective of male or female gonads. Mechanisms may include enhanced expression of genes that escape X chromosome inactivation. Major conclusions: Although less well studied than effects of gonadal hormones, sex chromosomes exert independent and interactive effects on adiposity, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. In particular, the presence of two X chromosomes has been associated with increased adiposity and dyslipidemia in mouse models and in XXY men. The enhanced expression of genes that escape X chromosome inactivation may contribute, but more work is required.","L2000709809 2018-05-08 2018-07-27","10.1016/j.molmet.2018.04.003","microRNA;sex hormone;adipose tissue;fat mass;gene;gene expression;genome-wide association study;genotype;gonad;human;hyperlipidemia;inflammation;karyotype 46,XX;Klinefelter syndrome;lipid level;lipid metabolism;lipid storage;non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;nonhuman;obesity;ovary;priority journal;review;sex chromosome;sex difference;SRY gene;testis;Turner syndrome;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;Sex Characteristics;Lipid Metabolism;Sex Chromosomes;Inflammation;Obesity",NA,NA

Analyses using a combination of gene expression data, ENCODE data, and evolutionary data of sex-biased gene expression in human tissues can give insight into the regulatory and evolutionary forces acting on sex-biased genes. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes between males and females. On the X chromosome, we used a novel method and investigated the status of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation (escape genes), taking into account the clonality of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). To investigate the regulation of sex-biased differentially expressed genes (sDEG), we conducted pathway and transcription factor enrichment analyses on the sDEGs, as well as analyses on the genomic distribution of sDEGs. Evolutionary analyses were also conducted on both sDEGs and escape genes. RESULTS: Genome-wide, we characterized differential gene expression between sexes in 462 RNA-seq samples and identified 587 sex-biased genes, or 3.2% of the genes surveyed. On the X chromosome, sDEGs were distributed in evolutionary strata in a similar pattern as escape genes. We found a trend of negative correlation between the gene expression breadth and nonsynonymous over synonymous mutation (dN/dS) ratios, showing a possible pleiotropic constraint on evolution of genes. Genome-wide, nine transcription factors were found enriched in binding to the regions surrounding the transcription start sites of female-biased genes. Many pathways and protein domains were enriched in sex-biased genes, some of which hint at sex-biased physiological processes.

Differential interactions with parents and conspecifics have additionally long-term influences on behavior. This presentation reviews available evidence indicating that these different mechanisms play a significant role in the control of sexual partner preference in animals and humans, in other words the homosexual versus heterosexual orientation. Clinical and epidemiological studies of phenotypically selected populations indicate that early actions of hormones and genetic factors clearly contribute to the determination of sexual orientation.

The disorder is characterized by microorchidism. Another typical although not constant symptom of this disorder is gynecomastia with almost normal male secondary sex characteristics. The etiology of the disease remains unexplained. Previous studies have shown that this disorder is a genetic chromosomal abnormality associated with the presence of one additional chromosome due to abnormal division. Thus, the affected individual has 47 chromosomes with the resulting chromosomal constellation of XXY (classical form) or 46,XY/47,XXX (mosaic form). Large population studies estimate the incidence of KS at 1: 1000 live born male babies [Hammerton JL, Canning N, Ray M, et al. A cytogenic survey of 14,069 newborn infants. I. Incidence of chromosome abnormalities. Clin Genet 1975;8:223-243]. The locomotor apparatus of persons affected by the syndrome is characterized by acromicria, clinodactyly, concrescence of thoracal vertebral bodies and spinal osteoporosis in not only individuals of older age but also in younger persons. In 1960s and 1970s, reports were published on the concurrence of the KS with autommume diseases. The aim of our article is to discuss case reports on the KS published by authors from our institute as well as to present an overview of the reports published so far, mainly abroad.

This hypothesis relates to nonsyndromic or essential autismwith an extremely highmale/female (M/F) ratio in infantswho are genetically normal except for common or lowpenetrance genetic variants. The hypothesiswas suggested by the discovery of TMLHE deficiency as an inborn error of carnitine biosynthesis in families with non-dysmorphic autismand the suggestion that TMLHE deficiency is a risk factor for nonsyndromic autism. The extremely high M/F ratio in a major subset of autism strongly suggests somemore homogeneous etiology for 10-20% of autism and provides a stimulus to understand the basis of the sex difference. We searched for a carnitine-related mechanism to explain the sex ratio, and found that the SLC6A14 protein is an amino acid/carnitine transporter functioning at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The human/mouse SLC6A14/Slc6a14 genes are located on the X chromosome and lack differentialmethylation on the inactive X chromosome suggesting escape from X-inactivation. Methods: We measured transport of radioactive carnitine across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after tail vein injection in mice. Mice were sacrificed four hours after injection and radioactive carnitine in the brain was quantitated by scintillation counting. Results: Transport of radioactive carnitine across the BBBwas greater in femalemice compared tomalemice likely due to lack of X-inactivation of Slc6a14. Transport of radioactive carnitine across the BBB was reduced in female and male Slc6a14 null mice compared to wild-type mice. Conclusions:We interpret the Slc6a14-mediated sex difference in transport of carnitine across the BBB as consistentwith the hypothesis that brain carnitine deficiency can cause autism.We hypothesize that human female infants transport carnitine across the BBBmore readily thanmale infants. We propose that differences in brain carnitine transport may contribute to sexual dimorphism of the brain and to the very high M/F ratio in milder autism.","L622060919 2018-05-14","10.1016/j.ymgme.2017.12.430","carnitine;endogenous compound;animal experiment;animal model;autism;blood brain barrier;carnitine deficiency;conference abstract;controlled study;female;girl;infancy;injection;intravenous drug administration;knockout mouse;male;mouse;nonhuman;prevention;scintillation counting;sex difference;sex ratio;stimulus;tail vein;wild type mouse;X chromosome inactivation;Autistic Disorder;Carnitine",NA,NA

Thus, mutations associated with neuropsychiatric conditions may result in sexually dimorphic symptoms by acting on different neural substrates or chromatin landscapes in males and females. Finally, as stress hormone signaling may directly alter the molecular machinery that interacts with sex hormone receptors to regulate gene expression, the contribution of chronic stress to the pathogenesis or presentation of mental illness may be additionally different between the sexes.

These parent-of-origin (PoO) effects have not yet been explored on the X chromosome, which motivated us to develop new methods for detecting such effects. Orofacial clefts (OFCs) exhibit sex-specific differences in prevalence and are examples of traits where a search for various types of effects on the X chromosome might be relevant. Materials and Methods: We upgraded our R-package Haplin to enable genome-wide analyses of PoO effects, as well as power simulations for different statistical models. 14,486 X-chromosome SNPs in 1,291 Asian and 1,118 European case-parent triads of isolated OFCs were available from a previous GWAS. For each ethnicity, cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate only (CPO) were analyzed separately using two X-inactivation models and a sliding-window approach to haplotype analysis. In addition, we performed analyses restricted to female offspring. Results: Associations were identified in ""Dystrophin"" (DMD, Xp21.2-p21.1), ""Fibroblast growth factor 13"" (FGF13, Xq26.3-q27.1) and ""EGF-like domain multiple 6"" (EGFL6, Xp22.2), with biologically plausible links to OFCs. Unlike EGFL6, the other associations on chromosomal region Xp22.2 had no apparent connections to OFCs. However, the Xp22.2 region itself is of potential interest because it contains genes for clefting syndromes [for example, ""Oral-facial-digital syndrome 1"" (OFD1) and ""Midline 1"" (MID1)]. Overall, the identified associations were highly specific for ethnicity, cleft subtype and X-inactivation model, except for DMD in which associations were identified in both CPO and CL/P, in the model with X-inactivation and in Europeans only. Discussion/Conclusion: The specificity of the associations for ethnicity, cleft subtype and X-inactivation model underscores the utility of conducting subanalyses, despite the ensuing need to adjust for additional multiple testing. Further investigations are needed to confirm the associations with DMD, EGF16, and FGF13. Furthermore, chromosomal region Xp22.2 appears to be a hotspot for genes implicated in clefting syndromes and thus constitutes an exciting direction to pursue in future OFCs research.

Epidemiological and genetic studies suggest a female protective effect (FPE) may account for part of this bias; however, the mechanism of such protection is unknown. Quantitative assessment of ASD symptoms using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) shows a bimodal distribution unique to females in multiplex families. This leads to the hypothesis that a single, common genetic locus on chromosome X might mediate the FPE and produce the ASD sex bias. Such a locus would represent a major therapeutic target and is likely to have been missed by conventional genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis. METHODS: To explore this possibility, we performed an association study in affected versus unaffected females, considering three tiers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as follows: 1) regions of chromosome X that escape X-inactivation, 2) all of chromosome X, and 3) genome-wide. RESULTS: No evidence of a SNP meeting the criteria for a single FPE locus was observed, despite the analysis being well powered to detect this effect.

The GRPR gene is located on the X chromosome and escapes X-chromosome inactivation, which occurs in females. Increasing evidence demonstrates that women are more susceptible than men to tobacco carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that the susceptibility of women to the effects of tobacco may be associated with airway expression of GRPR. METHODS: We analyzed GRPR messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in lung tissues and cultured airway cells from 78 individuals (40 males and 38 females) and in lung fibroblasts exposed to nicotine in vitro. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in airway cells were assayed by use of radioactively labeled nicotine and nicotine antagonists. A polymorphism in exon 2 of the GRPR gene was used to detect allele-specific GRPR mRNA expression in some individuals. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: GRPR mRNA expression was detected in airway cells and tissues of more female than male nonsmokers (55% versus 0%) and short-term smokers (1-25 pack-years [pack-years = number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years of smoking]) (75% versus 20%) (P =.018 for nonsmoking and short-term smoking females versus nonsmoking and short-term smoking males). Female smokers exhibited expression of GRPR mRNA at a lower mean pack-year exposure than male smokers (37.4 pack-years versus 56.3 pack-years; P =.037). Lung fibroblasts and bronchial epithelial cells exhibited high-affinity, saturable nicotinic acetylcholine-binding sites. Expression of GRPR mRNA in lung fibroblasts was elevated following exposure to nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the GRPR gene is expressed more frequently in women than in men in the absence of smoking and that expression of this gene is activated earlier in women in response to tobacco exposure. The presence of two expressed copies of the GRPR gene in females may be a factor in the increased susceptibility of women to tobacco-induced lung cancer.","Shriver, S P Bourdeau, H A Gubish, C T Tirpak, D L Davis, A L Luketich, J D Siegfried, J M CA50694/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.

Aging phenotypes and interventions are often sex-specific, indicating that both male and female sexual differentiation promote mitochondrial failure and aging. Studies in mammals and invertebrates implicate autophagy, apoptosis, AKT, PARP, p53 and FOXO in mediating sex-specific differences in stress resistance and aging. The data support a model where the genes Sxl in Drosophila, sdc-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans, and Xist in mammals regulate mitochondrial maintenance across generations and in aging. Several interventions that increase life span cause a mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), and UPRmt is also observed during normal aging, indicating hormesis. The UPRmt may increase life span by stimulating mitochondrial turnover through autophagy, and/or by inhibiting the production of hormones and toxic metabolites.

The mechanisms leading to sex biased disease prevalence are not well understood. However, for adult-onset autoimmune disease, at least some of the cause is usually ascribed to sex hormones. This is because levels of sex hormones are one of the most obvious physiological differences between adult males and females, and their impact on immune system function is well recognised. While for paediatric-onset autoimmune diseases a sex bias is not as common, there are several such diseases for which one sex predominates. For example, the oligoarticular subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) occurs in approximately three times more girls than boys, with a peak age of onset well before the onset of puberty, and at a time when levels of androgen and oestrogen are low and not strikingly different between the sexes. Here, we review potential explanations for autoimmune disease sex bias with a particular focus on paediatric autoimmune disease, and biological mechanisms outside of sex hormone differences.","L608922858 2016-04-21 2016-05-05","10.1016/j.jaut.2016.02.011","sex hormone;autoimmune disease;childhood disease;epigenetics;gender bias;genetic risk;genetics;human;immune response;priority journal;review;sexually dimorphic immune response;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;Autoimmune Diseases;Bias (Epidemiology);Autoimmunity",NA,NA

In the most classic scenario, one sex is characterized by a homologue pair of sex chromosomes, while the other includes two morphologically and functionally distinct gonosomes. In mammalian diploid cells, the female is characterized by the presence of two identical X chromosomes, while the male features an XY pair, with the Y bearing the major genetic determinant of sex, i.e. the SRY gene. In other species, such as the fruitfly, sex is determined by the ratio of autosomes to X chromosomes. Regardless of the exact mechanism, however, all these animals would exhibit a sex-specific gene expression inequality, due to the different number of X chromosomes, a phenomenon inhibited by a series of genetic and epigenetic regulatory events described as ""dosage compensation"". Since adequate available data is currently restricted to worms, flies and mammals, while for other groups of animals, such as reptiles, fish and birds it is very limited, it is not yet clear whether this is an evolutionary conserved mechanism. However certain striking similarities have already been observed among evolutionary distant species, such as Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus. These mainly refer to a) the need for a counting mechanism, to determine the chromosomal content of the cell, i.e. the ratio of autosomes to gonosomes (a process well understood in flies, but still hypothesized in mammals), b) the implication of non-translated, sex-specific, regulatory RNAs (roX and Xist, respectively) as key elements in this process and the location of similar mediators in the Z chromosome of chicken c) the inclusion of a chromatin modification epigenetic final step, which ensures that gene expression remains stably regulated throughout the affected area of the gonosome. This review summarizes these points and proposes a possible role for comparative genetics, as they seem to constitute proof of maintained cell economy (by using the same basic regulatory elements in various different scenarios) throughout numerous centuries of evolutionary history.","1477-7827 Angelopoulou, Roxani Lavranos, Giagkos Manolakou, Panagiota Journal Article Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Review England 2008/03/22 Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2008 Mar 20;6:12. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-6-12.","10.1186/1477-7827-6-12","Animals;*Biological Evolution;Diptera/*genetics;*Dosage Compensation, Genetic;Drosophila melanogaster/genetics;Gene Silencing;Hominidae/*genetics;Humans;Mammals/genetics;Mice/genetics;RNA/*physiology;*Sex Determination Processes;X Chromosome Inactivation;Humanities;Humanism",NA,NA

However, despite similar exposures, males and females often have altered disease susceptibility or progression from different stages of life. Fetal growth is largely mediated by the placenta, which, like the fetus is genetically XX or XY. The placenta and its associated trophoblast lineages originate from the trophectoderm (TE) of the early embryo. Rodent models (rat, mouse, spiny mouse), have been used extensively to examine placenta development and these have demonstrated the growth trajectory of the placenta in females is generally slower compared to males, and also shows altered adaptive responses to stressful environments. These placental adaptations are likely to depend on the type of stressor, duration, severity and the window of exposure during development. Here we describe the divergent developmental pathways between the male and female placenta contributing to altered differentiation of the TE derived trophoblast subtypes, placental growth, and formation of the placental architecture. Our focus is primarily genetic or environmental perturbations in rodent models which show altered placental responsiveness between sexes. We suggest that perturbations during early placental development may have greater impact on viability and growth of the female fetus whilst those occurring later in gestation may preferentially affect the male fetus.

Method: Methylation sensitive mRNA and miRNA from CD4+ T cells were identified by using experimentally demethylated in vitro system using DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azaC). Transcript profiling for isolated RNA was performed by using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.

The X chromosome encoded miRNAs; hsa-let-7f-2â, hsa-miR-503, hsa-miR-421, hsa-miR-188-3p, hsa-miR-513-a- 3p and hsa-miR-374a were found to be expressed higher in women compared to men in when the DNA was hypomethylated. Furthermore hsa-let-7f-2â, hsa-miR-503 and hsa-miR-188-3p were highly expressed in active female lupus patients tested (n =4) compared to the healthy controls. Functional Annotation clustering of these miRNA targets revealed that the genes belonging to âresponse to stressâ category being most affected. Conclusion: These results suggest that the miRNA overexpression due to DNA demethylation may contribute to the downregulation of genes observed in hypomethylated CD4+T cells. Furthermore, the demethylation of X chromosome resulting in elevated levels of X chromosome miRNAs, may play a major role in the decreased mRNA levels in stimulated CD4+ T cells in women. This in turn may contribute to the gender differences of gene expression levels. Better understanding of the intertwined connection between epigenetics to miRNAs and gene expression could add a new dimension to the understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to gender bias in autoimmune diseases.","L70443556 2011-06-27","10.1177/09612033100190010101","CD4 antigen;microRNA;DNA;messenger RNA;RNA;DNA methyltransferase inhibitor;decitabine;ionomycin;human;T lymphocyte;X chromosome;blood;female;gene;patient;demethylation;methylation;gender bias;gene expression;autoimmunity;gene overexpression;X chromosome inactivation;disease predisposition;in vitro study;human genome;genome;cell stimulation;stimulation;male;epigenetics;autoimmune disease;sex difference;regulatory sequence;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;X Chromosome",NA,NA

Sex-based differences in immunologic response and hormonal expression help explain the differences in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes observed in biological males and females. X inactivation facilitates a robust immune response to COVID-19 in females, who demonstrate a more profound antibody response and faster recovery when compared to males.

Developmental differences in this window such as sex-specific variation are implicated in later placental disease states, yet gene expression at this time is poorly understood. METHODS: RNA-sequencing was performed to characterize the transcriptome of 39 first trimester human placentas using chorionic villi following genetic testing (17 females, 22 males). Gene enrichment analysis was performed to find enriched canonical pathways and gene ontologies in the first trimester. DESeq2 was used to find sexually dimorphic gene expression. Patient demographics were analyzed for sex differences in fetal weight at time of chorionic villus sampling and birth. RESULTS: RNA-sequencing analyses detected 14,250 expressed genes, with chromosome 19 contributing the greatest proportion (973/2852, 34.1% of chromosome 19 genes) and Y chromosome contributing the least (16/568, 2.8%). Several placenta-enriched genes as well as histone-coding genes were identified to be unique to the first trimester and common to both sexes. Further, we identified 58 genes with significantly different expression between males and females: 25 X-linked, 15 Y-linked, and 18 autosomal genes. Genes that escape X inactivation were highly represented (59.1%) among X-linked genes upregulated in females. Many genes differentially expressed by sex consisted of X/Y gene pairs, suggesting that dosage compensation plays a role in sex differences. These X/Y pairs had roles in parallel, ancient canonical pathways important for eukaryotic cell growth and survival: chromatin modification, transcription, splicing, and translation. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first characterization of the late first trimester placenta transcriptome, highlighting similarities and differences among the sexes in ongoing human pregnancies resulting in live births. Sexual dimorphism may contribute to pregnancy outcomes, including fetal growth and birth weight, which was seen in our cohort, with males significantly heavier than females at birth. This transcriptome provides a basis for development of early diagnostic tests of placental function that can indicate overall pregnancy heath, fetal-maternal health, and long-term adult health.","L626493711 2019-02-28 2019-04-05","10.1186/s13293-018-0165-y","transcriptome;chorion villus;female;first trimester pregnancy;genetics;human;male;metabolism;newborn;pregnancy;sexual characteristics;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Sex Characteristics;Transcriptome;Pregnancy Trimester, Third;Pregnancy Trimester, First;Placenta",NA,NA

In this scenario, males could accumulate more cells within a defined window of development. Another key difference between males and females is the number of copies of genes located on the sex chromosomes. Transcripts from the Y-chromosome are thought to function as transcription factors, which could accelerate development. Conversely, the X-chromosome contains genes that code for rate limiting steps in pathways key to embryo metabolism and stress reduction. It can be envisioned that prior to X-chromosome inactivation in females, elevated levels of transcripts for such genes may enable greater protection from environmental stress and regulate growth.

The striking female predominance was initially attributed primarily to sex hormones. However, recent data challenge this simplistic view and point more towards genetic and epigenetic factors accounting for this difference. More specifically, several SLE-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to play an important role in the gender predilection in SLE. Their effect is mediated through their involvement in sex-hormone and immune system signalling and dysregulation of the expression of genes and miRNAs pertinent to the immune system. Additionally, the genetic factors are interchangeably associated with epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modification, thus revealing a highly complex network of responsible mechanisms. Of importance, disturbance in the epigenetic process of X chromosome inactivation in females as well as in rare X chromosome abnormalities leads to increased expression of X-linked immune-related genes and miRNAs, which might predispose females to SLE. Microbiota dysbiosis has also been implicated in the sexual dimorphism by the production of oestrogens within the gut and the regulation of oestrogen-responsive immune-related genes. Sexual dimorphism in SLE is an area of active research, and elucidation of its molecular basis may facilitate ongoing efforts towards personalized care.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 25 Total Times Cited: 26 Cited Reference Count: 50","10.1177/0961203318815768","Female predominance;lupus;genetic;epigenetic;microbiota;hormones;SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS;T-CELLS;GUT MICROBIOME;GENDER BIAS;GENES;WOMEN;INACTIVATION;PATHOGENESIS;ASSOCIATION;EXPRESSION;Gonadal Steroid Hormones",NA,NA

In addition to the action of sex steroid hormones, there is growing evidence for a role of genetic factors linked to the X chromosome. In female mammals, following the mechanisms of X chromosome inactivation (ICX), one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated, resulting in a cellular mosaicism, where about one-half of the cells in a tissue express the maternal X chromosome and the other half the paternal one. However, 15â23% of inactive X (Xi) genes escape XCI, contributing to the emergence of a female specific heterogeneous population of cells expressing the same gene from both X chromosomes. Among these genes, some immune-related genes have recently been identified. Although the direct contribution of this genetic mechanism in the female susceptibility to autoimmunity remains to be fully established, the cellular mosaicism resulting from XCI and escape from XCI is likely to create a unique functional plasticity within female immune cells.","L2010712478 2021-02-26 2021-03-15","10.1016/j.monrhu.2020.10.002","estrogen;sex hormone;autoimmune disease;disease predisposition;female;heredity;human;immune-related gene;immunocompetent cell;lymphocyte;male;mosaicism;sex difference;short survey;X chromosome inactivation;Autoimmune Diseases;Lymphocytes;Autoimmunity",NA,NA

To achieve similar expression, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is initiated in female cells during early stages of embryogenesis. Within each cell, either the maternal or paternal X chromosome is selected for whole chromosome transcriptional silencing, which is initiated and maintained by epigenetic and chromatin conformation mechanisms. With the emergence of small-molecule epigenetic inhibitors for the treatment of disease, such as cancer, the epigenetic mechanism underlying XCI may be inadvertently targeted. Here, we test 2 small-molecule epigenetic inhibitors being used clinically, GSK126 (a histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase inhibitor) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (a histone deacetylase inhibitor), on their effects of the inactive X (Xi) in healthy human female fibroblasts. The combination of these modifiers, at subcancer therapeutic levels, leads to the inability to detect the repressive H3K27me3 modification characteristic of XCI in the majority of the cells. Importantly, genes positioned near the X-inactivation center (Xic), where inactivation is initiated, exhibit robust expression with treatment of the inhibitors, while genes located near the distal ends of the X chromosome intriguingly exhibit significant downregulation. These results demonstrate that small-molecule epigenetic inhibitors can have profound consequences on XCI in human cells, and they underscore the importance of considering gender when developing and clinically testing small-molecule epigenetic inhibitors, in particular those that target the well-characterized mechanisms of X inactivation.","2470-2900 Laskowski, Agnieszka I Fanslow, Danielle A Smith, Erica D Kosak, Steven T DP2 OD008717/OD/NIH HHS/United States F32 GM115046/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States T32 GM008061/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States Journal Article United States 2018/01/01 Gend Genome. 2018 Jan;2(1):2-7. doi: 10.1177/2470289718787106.

Diverse molecular mechanisms have evolved to effectively balance the expressed dose of X-linked genes between XX and XY animals, and to balance expression of X and autosomal genes. Dosage compensation is not understood in birds, in which females (ZW) and males (ZZ) differ in the number of Z chromosomes. RESULTS: Using microarray analysis, we compared the male:female ratio of expression of sets of Z-linked and autosomal genes in two bird species, zebra finch and chicken, and in two mammalian species, mouse and human. Male:female ratios of expression were significantly higher for Z genes than for autosomal genes in several finch and chicken tissues. In contrast, in mouse and human the male:female ratio of expression of X-linked genes is quite similar to that of autosomal genes, indicating effective dosage compensation even in humans, in which a significant percentage of genes escape X-inactivation. CONCLUSION: Birds represent an unprecedented case in which genes on one sex chromosome are expressed on average at constitutively higher levels in one sex compared with the other.

This hypothesis involves nonsyndromic or âessentialâ autism with an extremely high male/female ratio in infants who are genetically normal except for common or low penetrance genetic variants. These infants are hypothesized to have a normal physical examination and structurally normal brain imaging, and we characterize this as a non-Mendelian, nondysmorphic (NoMeND) form of autism. These infants are hypothesized to develop deficiency of carnitine and perhaps other nutrients in the brain causing autism that may be amenable to early reversal and prevention through dietary supplementation with carnitine. A mixed, common gene variant-environment hypothesis is proposed with diet, minor illnesses, microbiome, and drugs as possible risk modifiers. We searched for a carnitine-related explanation for the high male/female ratio and found that a gene on the X chromosome in humans and mice (SLC6A14/ Slc6a14) likely escapes random X-inactivation based on the absence of differential methylation on the inactive X chromosome in both species. The SLC6A14 protein is an amino acid and carnitine transporter that functions at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The lack of X-inactivation could lead to greater expression in females than males at the BBB and could limit transport of carnitine across the blood-brain barrier in boys compared to girls. We assessed transport across the BBB in mice by tail vein injection of [14C]-carnitine. At 4 hours, transport to the brain was greater in wild-type female mice compared to male mice, likely due to lack of X-inactivation of Slc6a14. Transport of [14C]-carnitine across the BBB is reduced in female and male Slc6a14 null mutants compared to wild-type mice. These data suggest that Slc6a14-mediated transport across the BBB is greater in female compared to male mice. We propose that differences in carnitine transport across the BBB may contribute to metabolic sexual dimorphism of the brain in mammals, possibly explaining the extremely high male/female ratio in nonsyndromic autism via susceptibility to brain carnitine deficiency. Perhaps the lack of any Recommended Dietary Allowance for carnitine in infants should be reviewed.","L623678029 2018-09-04","10.1177/2326409817722292","carnitine;endogenous compound;animal experiment;animal model;autism;blood brain barrier;carnitine deficiency;conference abstract;controlled study;diet supplementation;dietary reference intake;female;genetic susceptibility;genetic variability;girl;intravenous drug administration;loss of function mutation;male;methylation;microbiome;mouse;nonhuman;nutrient;penetrance;physical examination;protein function;sex difference;tail vein;wild type mouse;X chromosome inactivation;Carnitine;Blood-Brain Barrier;Brain;Autistic Disorder",NA,NA

The process of X chromosome inactivation regulated by lncRNA Xist is important for dose compensation of immune-related X-linked genes between the sexes. This study aimed to explore a Xist-related pathway which might lead to the female preponderance of NMOSD. Some studies have shown that lncRNA Xist may interact with transactive response DNA-binding protein (TARDBP, also known as TDP43). TDP43 can be cleaved by caspase-3 into its active form, TDP35, which might increase the level of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), while IRF3 may promote the proliferation of Th17 cells. Our preliminary study conducted in peripheral blood mononuclear cell of female NMOSD patients showed the same trend with above literatures. Based on those studies and our preliminary results, we hypothesized that in the CD4+ na??ve T cells of female NMOSD patients, the downregulation of lncRNA Xist decreased its interaction with TDP43 and released more TDP43 to be cleaved to its active form TDP35, thereby inhibits IRF3 degradation, and then promotes the differentiation and proliferation of Th17 cells and induced the inflammation of female NMOSD patients. This study would shed further light on the immune regulation mechanism related to lncRNA Xist, which may play a key role in the sex bias of NMOSD.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 0 Total Times Cited: 0 Cited Reference Count: 26","10.1016/j.mehy.2022.110894","NMOSD;LncRNA Xist;TDP43;IRF3;T helper 17;TARGETS;Cell Differentiation",NA,NA

Results: Here, we comprehensively characterize 5hmC in the prefrontal cortices of 24 subjects. We show that, although there is inter-individual variability in 5hmC content among unrelated individuals, approximately 8 % of all CpGs on autosomal chromosomes contain 5hmC, while sex chromosomes contain far less. Our data also provide evidence suggesting that 5hmC has transcriptional regulatory properties, as the density of 5hmC was highest in enhancer regions and within exons. Furthermore, we link increased 5hmC density to histone modification binding sites, to the gene bodies of actively transcribed genes, and to exon-intron boundaries. Finally, we provide several genomic regions of interest that contain gender-specific 5hmC.

Identification of epigenetic alterations occurring in these disorders could shed light on molecular pathways relevant to neurodevelopment. Results: Using a genome-wide approach, we identified genes with significant loss of DNA methylation in blood of males with intellectual disability and mutations in the X-linked KDM5C gene, encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase, in comparison to age/sex matched controls. Loss of DNA methylation in such individuals is consistent with known interactions between DNA methylation and H3 lysine 4 methylation. Further, loss of DNA methylation at the promoters of the three top candidate genes FBXL5, SCMH1, CACYBP was not observed in more than 900 population controls. We also found that DNA methylation at these three genes in blood correlated with dosage of KDM5C and its Y-linked homologue KDM5D. In addition, parallel sex-specific DNA methylation profiles in brain samples from control males and females were observed at FBXL5 and CACYBP. Conclusions: We have, for the first time, identified epigenetic alterations in patient samples carrying a mutation in a gene involved in the regulation of histone modifications. These data support the concept that DNA methylation and H3 lysine 4 methylation are functionally interdependent.

Developmental differences in this window such as sex-specific variation are implicated in later placental disease states, yet gene expression at this time is poorly understood. Methods: RNA-sequencing was performed to characterize the transcriptome of 39 first trimester human placentas using chorionic villi following genetic testing (17 females, 22 males). Gene enrichment analysis was performed to find enriched canonical pathways and gene ontologies in the first trimester. DESeq2 was used to find sexually dimorphic gene expression. Patient demographics were analyzed for sex differences in fetal weight at time of chorionic villus sampling and birth. Results: RNA-sequencing analyses detected 14,250 expressed genes, with chromosome 19 contributing the greatest proportion (973/2852, 34.1% of chromosome 19 genes) and Y chromosome contributing the least (16/568, 2.8%). Several placenta-enriched genes as well as histone-coding genes were identified to be unique to the first trimester and common to both sexes. Further, we identified 58 genes with significantly different expression between males and females: 25 X-linked, 15 Y-linked, and 18 autosomal genes. Genes that escape X inactivation were highly represented (59.1%) among X-linked genes upregulated in females. Many genes differentially expressed by sex consisted of X/Y gene pairs, suggesting that dosage compensation plays a role in sex differences. These X/Y pairs had roles in parallel, ancient canonical pathways important for eukaryotic cell growth and survival: chromatin modification, transcription, splicing, and translation. Conclusions: This study is the first characterization of the late first trimester placenta transcriptome, highlighting similarities and differences among the sexes in ongoing human pregnancies resulting in live births. Sexual dimorphism may contribute to pregnancy outcomes, including fetal growth and birth weight, which was seen in our cohort, with males significantly heavier than females at birth. This transcriptome provides a basis for development of early diagnostic tests of placental function that can indicate overall pregnancy heath, fetal-maternal health, and long-term adult health.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 64 Total Times Cited: 67 Cited Reference Count: 126","10.1186/s13293-018-0165-y","Sex differences;First trimester placenta;Chorionic villus sampling;Pregnancy;RNA-sequencing;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;GENE-EXPRESSION;DNA METHYLATION;NONCODING RNA;DOMAIN FAMILY;Y-CHROMOSOMES;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Sex Characteristics;Transcriptome;Pregnancy Trimester, Third;Pregnancy Trimester, First;Placenta",NA,NA

While susceptibility genes located in the sex chromosomes have been identified in ASD, it is unclear whether they are sufficient to explain the male bias or whether gonadal hormones also play a key role. We evaluated the sex chromosomal and hormonal influences on the male bias in a murine model of ASD, in which mice are exposed in utero to a maternal antibody reactive to contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2), which was originally cloned from a mother of a child with ASD (termed C6 mice henceforth). In this model, only male mice are affected. We used the four-core-genotypes (FCG) model in which the Sry gene is deleted from the Y chromosome (Y-) and inserted into autosome 3 (TgSry). Thus, by combining the C6 and FCG models, we were able to differentiate the contributions of sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones to the development of fetal brain and adult behavioral phenotypes. We show that the presence of the Y chromosome, or lack of two X chromosomes, irrespective of gonadal sex, increased the susceptibility to C6-induced phenotypes including the abnormal growth of the developing fetal cerebral cortex, as well as a behavioral pattern of decreased open-field exploration in adult mice. Our results indicate that sex chromosomes are the main determinant of the male bias in the maternal C6-induced model of ASD.

Epidemiologic studies have shifted from an exclusive focus on the identification of genetic risk alleles for such disorders to recognizing and understanding the contribution of xenobiotic exposures, infections, and the maternal immune system during the prenatal and early post-natal periods. In this review we discuss the growing literature regarding the effects of maternal brain-reactive antibodies on fetal brain development and their contribution to the development of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Autoimmune diseases primarily affect women and are more prevalent in mothers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, mothers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are significantly more likely to have an autoimmune disease than women of neurotypically developing children. Moreover, they are four to five times more likely to harbor brain-reactive antibodies than unselected women of childbearing age. Many of these women exhibit no apparent clinical consequence of harboring these antibodies, presumably because the antibodies never access brain tissue. Nevertheless, these maternal brain-reactive antibodies can access the fetal brain, and some may be capable of altering brain development when present during pregnancy. Several animal models have provided evidence that in utero exposure to maternal brain-reactive antibodies can permanently alter brain anatomy and cause persistent behavioral or cognitive phenotypes. Although this evidence supports a contribution of maternal brain-reactive antibodies to neurodevelopmental disorders, an interplay between antibodies, genetics, and other environmental factors is likely to determine the specific neurodevelopmental phenotypes and their severity. Additional modulating factors likely also include the microbiome, sex chromosomes, and gonadal hormones. These interactions may help to explain the sex-bias observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies on this topic provide a unique opportunity to learn how to identify and protect at risk pregnancies while also deciphering critical pathways in neurodevelopment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 11 Total Times Cited: 11 Cited Reference Count: 178","10.3389/fimmu.2019.01129","brain-reactive antibodies;autism spectrum disorder;neurodevelopmental disorders;sex bias;gonadal hormones;sex chromosomes;microbiome;AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS;BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER;PARANEOPLASTIC NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS;SEX-CHROMOSOME COMPLEMENT;X-INACTIVATION PROFILE;GENE-EXPRESSION;GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR;GUT MICROBIOTA;FETAL-BRAIN;DEVELOPMENTAL-DISABILITIES;Animal Shells;Animals",NA,NA

Certain biological phenomena, such as X chromosome inactivation and parental imprinting, affect ASE most drastically by completely shutting down the expression of a whole set of alleles. Other more subtle effects on ASE are likely to be much more complex and dependent on the genetic environment and are perhaps more important to understand since they may be responsible for a significant amount of biological diversity. Tools to assess ASE in a diploid biological system are becoming more reliable. Non-diploid systems are, however, not uncommon. In humans full or partial polyploid states are regularly found in both healthy (meiotic cells, polynucleated cell types) and diseased tissues (trisomies, non-disjunction events, cancerous tissues). In this work we have studied ASE in the medaka fish model system. We have developed a method for determining ASE in polyploid organisms from RNAseq data and we have implemented this method in a software tool set. As a biological model system we have used nuclear transplantation to experimentally produce artificial triploid medaka composed of three different haplomes. We measured ASE in RNA isolated from the livers of two adult, triploid medaka fish that showed a high degree of similarity. The majority of genes examined (82%) shared expression more or less evenly among the three alleles in both triploids. The rest of the genes (18%) displayed a wide range of ASE levels. Interestingly the majority of genes (78%) displayed generally consistent ASE levels in both triploid individuals. A large contingent of these genes had the same allele entirely suppressed in both triploids. When viewed in a chromosomal context, it is revealed that these genes are from large sections of 4 chromosomes and may be indicative of some broad scale suppression of gene expression.

While the elderly are most severely affected, implicating an age bias, a striking factor in the demographics of this deadly disease is the gender bias, with higher numbers of cases, greater disease severity, and higher death rates among men than women across the lifespan. While pre-existing comorbidities and social, behavioral, and lifestyle factors contribute to this bias, biological factors underlying the host immune response may be crucial contributors. Women mount stronger immune responses to infections and vaccinations and outlive men. Sex-based biological factors underlying the immune response are therefore important determinants of susceptibility to infections, disease outcomes, and mortality. Despite this, gender is a profoundly understudied and often overlooked variable in research related to the immune response and infectious diseases, and it is largely ignored in drug and vaccine clinical trials. Understanding these factors will not only help better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19, but it will also guide the design of effective therapies and vaccine strategies for gender-based personalized medicine.

Therefore, more understanding of the sex-specific mechanisms that lead to ischemic stroke and aggravation of secondary damage after stroke is needed. Our current mechanistic understanding of cerebral ischemia states that endothelial quiescence in neurovascular units (NVUs) is a major physiological parameter affecting the cellular response to neuron, astrocyte and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) injury. Although a hallmark of the response to injury in these cells is transcriptional activation, noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs exhibit cell-type and context dependent regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. This review assesses whether sex-specific microRNA expression (either derived from X-chromosome loci following incomplete X-chromosome inactivation or regulated by estrogen in their biogenesis) in these cells controls NVU quiescence, and as such, could differentiate stroke pathophysiology in women compared to men. Their adverse expression was found to decrease tight junction affinity in endothelial cells and activate VSMC proliferation, while their regulation of paracrine astrocyte signaling was shown to neutralize sex-specific apoptotic pathways in neurons. As such, these microRNAs have cell type-specific functions in astrocytes and vascular cells which act on one another, thereby affecting the cell viability of neurons. Furthermore, these microRNAs display actual and potential clinical implications as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in ischemic stroke and in predicting therapeutic response to antiplatelet therapy. In conclusion, this review improves the current mechanistic understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to ischemic stroke in women and highlights the clinical promise of sex-specific microRNAs as novel diagnostic biomarkers for (silent) ischemic stroke.","L2014363403 2021-11-24 2022-06-15","10.3390/ijms222111888","antithrombocytic agent;biological marker;estrogen;microRNA;anticoagulant therapy;apoptosis;astrocyte;biogenesis;blood brain barrier;brain injury;brain ischemia;brain nerve cell;cell proliferation;cell viability;disease exacerbation;disease severity;endothelium cell;gene expression;human;ischemic stroke;neuroapoptosis;nonhuman;pathophysiology;review;sex chromosome mosaicism;sex difference;tight junction;treatment response;vascular smooth muscle cell;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Stroke",NA,NA

Women with FD often show highly heterogeneous symptoms that can manifest from mild to severe phenotype. Main body: The phenotypic variability of the clinical manifestations in heterozygous women with FD mainly depends on the degree and direction of inactivation of the X chromosome. Classical approaches to measure XCI skewness might be not sufficient to explain disease manifestation in women. In addition to unbalanced XCI, allele-specific DNA methylation at promoter of GLA gene may influence the expression levels of the mutated allele, thus impacting the onset and the outcome of FD. In this regard, analyses of DNA methylation at GLA promoter, performed by approaches allowing distinction between mutated and non-mutated allele, may be much more informative. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate recent literature articles addressing the potential role of DNA methylation in the context of FD. Although up to date relatively few works have addressed this point, reviewing all pertinent studies may help to evaluate the importance of DNA methylation analysis in FD and to develop new research and technologies aimed to predict whether the carrier females will develop symptoms. Conclusions: Relatively few studies have addressed the complexity of DNA methylation landscape in FD that remains poorly investigated. The hope for the future is that ad hoc and ultradeep methylation analyses of GLA gene will provide epigenetic signatures able to predict whether pre-symptomatic female carriers will develop symptoms thus helping timely interventions.","L2010356536 2021-02-10 2021-02-16","10.1186/s13148-021-01019-3","alpha galactosidase;calcitonin gene related peptide;calcitonin receptor;genomic DNA;globotriaosylceramide;autosome;bisulfite sequencing;disease severity;DNA methylation;enzyme replacement;Fabry disease;family history;gene;GLA gene;heterozygote;human;nanopore sequencing;neuropathic pain;phenotypic variation;point mutation;priority journal;promoter region;review;Sanger sequencing;sex difference;X chromosome inactivation;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Fabry Disease;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Methylation;DNA Methylation",NA,NA

Yet whether the resulting sex differences are perpetuated throughout development and how they connect to the sex-specific expression patterns in adult tissues is not known. There is a dearth of information on the timing and continuity of sex biases during development. It is also unclear whether sex-specific selection operates during embryogenesis. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that all adult tissues exhibit sex-specific expression patterns, some of which are independent of hormonal influence and due to intrinsic regulatory effects of the sex chromosome constitution. There are many diseases with origins during embryogenesis that also exhibit sex biases. Epigenetics has provided us with viable mechanisms to explain how the genome stores the memory of developmental events. We propose that some of these marks can be traced back to the sex chromosomes, which interact with the autosomes and establish sex-specific epigenetic features soon after fertilization. Sex-biased epigenetic marks that linger after reprograming may reveal themselves at the transcriptional level at later developmental stages and possibly, throughout the lifespan. Detailed molecular information on the ontogeny of sex biases would also elucidate the sex-specific selective pressures operating on embryos and how compensatory mechanisms evolved to resolve sexual conflict.","L629462591 2019-10-08 2019-10-11","10.3389/fcell.2019.00186","autosome;developmental stage;epigenetics;genomics;nonhuman;ontogeny;preimplantation embryo;review;sex chromosome;sex difference;systems biology;X chromosome inactivation;Genomics;Genome",NA,NA

The expression of most X-borne genes is equalized between XX females and XY males in therian mammals (marsupials and ""placentals"") by inactivating one X chromosome in female somatic cells. However, compensation seems not to be strictly required to equalize the expression of most Z-borne genes between ZZ male and ZW female birds. Whether dosage compensation operates in the third mammal lineage, the egg-laying monotremes, is of considerable interest, since the platypus has a complex sex chromosome system in which five X and five Y chromosomes share considerable genetic homology with the chicken ZW sex chromosome pair, but not with therian XY chromosomes. The assignment of genes to four platypus X chromosomes allowed us to examine X dosage compensation in this unique species. Quantitative PCR showed a range of compensation, but SNP analysis of several X-borne genes showed that both alleles are transcribed in a heterozygous female. Transcription of 14 BACs representing 19 X-borne genes was examined by RNA-FISH in female and male fibroblasts. An autosomal control gene was expressed from both alleles in nearly all nuclei, and four pseudoautosomal BACs were usually expressed from both alleles in male as well as female nuclei, showing that their Y loci are active. However, nine X-specific BACs were usually transcribed from only one allele. This suggests that while some genes on the platypus X are not dosage compensated, other genes do show some form of compensation via stochastic transcriptional inhibition, perhaps representing an ancestral system that evolved to be more tightly controlled in placental mammals such as human and mouse.

IRIS-related infectious events are distributed similarly between adult males and females, albeit a few studies have shown a skewing toward the male sex in pediatric IRIS. Here, we assessed sex-specific differences in the causes and extent of IRIS infectious events in HIV-infected pediatric patients on ART. We carried out a prospective clinical analysis (from 2000 to 2018) of IRIS-related infectious events after ART in a cohort of 82 Brazilian children and adolescents infected with HIV-1 through mother-to-child transmission as well as a comprehensive cross-referencing with public records on IRIS-related infectious causes in pediatric HIV/AIDS. Twelve events fulfilling the criteria of IRIS occurred exclusively in 11 females in our cohort. The median age at IRIS events was 3.6 years. The infectious causes included Mycobacterium bovis, varicella-zoster virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, human papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In one female, there was regional bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin dissemination and cytomegalovirus esophagitis. There was complete health recovery after 10 IRIS events without the use of corticosteroids or ART interruption. One case of IRIS-associated miliary tuberculosis was fatal. The biological female sex was a significant risk factor for IRIS events (odds ratio: 23.67; 95% confidence interval 95%: 1.341-417.7; P = 0.0016 and P < 0.01 by the multivariable analysis).

However, random XCI results in expression of both alleles in most females. Allelic imbalances have been used genome-wide to detect mono-allelically expressed genes. Analysis of X-linked allelic imbalance in females with skewed XCI offers the opportunity to identify genes that escape XCI with bi-allelic expression in contrast to those with mono-allelic expression and which are therefore subject to XCI.Results: We determine XCI status for 409 genes, all of which have at least five informative females in our dataset. The majority of genes are subject to XCI and genes that escape from XCI show a continuum of expression from the inactive X. Inactive X expression corresponds to differences in the level of histone modification detected by allelic imbalance after chromatin immunoprecipitation. Differences in XCI between populations and between cell lines derived from different tissues are observed.Conclusions: We demonstrate that allelic imbalance can be used to determine an inactivation status for X-linked genes, even without completely non-random XCI. There is a range of expression from the inactive X. Genes escaping XCI, including those that do so in only a subset of females, cluster together, demonstrating that XCI and location on the X chromosome are related. In addition to revealing mechanisms involved in cis-gene regulation, determining which genes escape XCI can expand our understanding of the contributions of X-linked genes to sexual dimorphism.

The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission presents diversity of human host and increased disease risk with advancing age, highlighting the importance of in depth understanding of its biological properties. Structural analyses have elucidated hot spots in viral binding domains, mutations and specific proteins in the host such as the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to be implicated in cell entry and viral infectivity. Furthermore, epigenetic changes that regulate chromatin structure have shown a major impact in genome stabilization and maintenance of cellular homeostasis and they have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the virus infection. Epigenetic research has revealed that global DNA methylation along with ACE2 gene methylation and post-translational histone modifications may drive differences in host tissue-, biological age- and sex-biased patterns of viral infection. Moreover, modulation of the host cells epigenetic landscape following infection represents a molecular tool used by viruses to antagonize cellular signaling as well as sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs in order to enhance viral replication and infection efficiency. In this review, we provide an update of the main research findings at the interface of epigenetics and coronavirus infection. In particular, we highlight the epigenetic factors that interfere with viral replication and infection and may contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility, offering new ways of thinking in respect to host viral response.","L2005621632 2020-07-29 2020-08-11","10.1080/15592294.2020.1796896","angiotensin converting enzyme 2;BMI1 protein;cathepsin L;DNA methyltransferase 3A;furin;histone deacetylase 2;long untranslated RNA;serine proteinase inhibitor;transcriptome;adaptive immunity;binding affinity;chromatin structure;coronavirus disease 2019;disease severity;DNA sequence;epigenetics;gene expression profiling;genetic transcription;histone acetylation;histone modification;human;hypertension;immune response;nonhuman;open reading frame;pathophysiology;protein processing;protein protein interaction;review;risk factor;RNA sequence;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;sex difference;signal transduction;ubiquitination;virus infectivity;virus replication;virus transmission;X chromosome inactivation",NA,NA

The X-linked monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) was considered as a susceptibility gene to substance abuse of tobacco, but the evolutionary effect of MAOA may lead to a positive or negative association between genetic variations and smoking development among study regions. Methods Based on linkage disequilibrium (LD), we performed a haplotype-based association to explore the effect of MAOA gene on women's smoking risk in a case-control study. Results Genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MAOA gene, rs5953210G>A, rs2283725A>G and rs1137070T>C, were significantly associated with current smoking risk in women, and the increased level of plasma MAO-A activity was raised with per copy increment of risk allele in current smokers (P < .01). The haplotype patterns with minor haplotype frequency >.05 were constructed using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and the haplotype-specific A-G-C pattern raised the 2-fold risk to develop regular smoking (P = .0005). In the diplotype analysis based on X-inactivation mechanism relative to no and full dosage compensation, we showed that A-G-C haplotype not only increased regular smoking risk in a dose-dependent manner (P-trend = .0011) but also contributed to smoking risk in the dosage compensation mechanism. Compared to non-smokers, the effect of A-G-C haplotype on random X-activation was associated with the raised MAO-A activity in women smokers (P < .05) although the lifetime cigarette consumption showed a difference that was not statistically significant.

Paradoxically, the numbers of anti-viral natural killer (NK) cells are increased in males compared to females. Using samples from mice and humans, we demonstrate that while numbers of male NK cells are increased compared to females, they display impaired production of the anti-viral cytokine IFN-Î³. These sex differences were not due solely to divergent levels of gonadal hormones, since these differences persisted in gonadectomized mice. Instead, these differences can be attributed to lower male expression of X-linked Kdm6a (UTX), an epigenetic regulator which escapes X inactivation in female NK cells. NK cell-specific UTX deletion in females phenocopied multiple features of male NK cells, which include increased numbers and reduced IFN-Î³ production. Integrative ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis revealed a critical role for UTX in the regulation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression at loci important in NK cell homeostasis and effector function. Consequently, NK cell-intrinsic UTX levels are critical for optimal anti-viral immunity, since mice with NK cell-intrinsic UTX deficiency show increased lethality to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) challenge. Taken together, these data implicate UTX as a critical molecular determinant of NK cell sex differences and suggest enhancing UTX function as a new strategy to boost endogenous NK cell anti-viral responses.","L2018217537 2022-06-07","10.1101/2022.04.21.489076","adult;animal experiment;animal tissue;chromatin;controlled study;epigenetics;female;gene deletion;gene expression;homeostasis;human;lethality;male;mouse;Murine cytomegalovirus;natural killer cell;nonhuman;protein expression;RNA sequencing;sex difference;virus immunity;X chromosome inactivation;antivirus agent;cytokine;endogenous compound;gamma interferon;sex hormone;Sex Characteristics",NA,NA

Gender influences clinical presentations and markers in inflammatory diseases. In many chronic conditions, frequency of complications is greater in females, suggesting that continuous inflammatory reaction may induce greater damage in targeted organs and functions. Methods. To investigate gender dimorphism at a cellular level, we evaluated the production of cytokines implicated in inflammatory processes (IL-1, IL-6, PGE-2 and TNF alpha), in healthy prepubescent children of both sex and Turner's syndrome (TS) patients (genotype XO). We used stimulation by LPS (0.2 and 1 ng/ml) and Pokeweed Mitogen (PWM) on overnight cultures from whole blood samples, collected in 57 subjects: 22 girls/26 boys (5-96 months), and 9 TS patients (6-15 years). The primary outcome was to evaluate if gender influences the production of cytokines, with potential relation to X chromosome monosomy. Secondary endpoints were to relate different cytokines level productions and conditions. Results. We confirm the male over female increased cytokine productions already observed in adults. This is contrasting with numerous observations obtained in vivo about increased production of inflammatory markers in females (CRP, ESR and neutrophil counts), as we recently reported in children. Relative variations of the dimorphism according to stimulus, its concentration and cytokine type are discussed, presenting IL6 with a modulating function that could be more potent in males. TS subjects follow mostly the male pattern of reactivity, sustaining the role of some gene expression differing with X chromosome monosomy and disomy. Conclusions. Persistence of the latter dimorphism throughout life casts doubts on its direct relationship with individual hormonal status, as already documented by others in vitro, and supports the need for alternative hypothesis, such as the influence of X chromosome gene products escaping X inactivation in females and absent in subjects with X monosomy (males, TS).

One such example is that a year after her original 1961 hypothesis she proposed that genes with Y homologues should escape from X inactivation to achieve dosage compensation between males and females. Fifty-five years later we have learned many details about these escapees that we attempt to summarize in this review, with a particular focus on recent findings. We now know that escapees are not rare, particularly on the human X, and that most lack functionally equivalent Y homologues, leading to their increasingly recognized role in sexually dimorphic traits. Newer sequencing technologies have expanded profiling of primary tissues that will better enable connections to sex-biased disorders as well as provide additional insights into the X-inactivation process. Chromosome organization, nuclear location and chromatin environments distinguish escapees from other X-inactivated genes. Nevertheless, several big questions remain, including what dictates their distinct epigenetic environment, the underlying basis of species differences in escapee regulation, how different classes of escapees are distinguished, and the roles that local sequences and chromosome ultrastructure play in escapee regulation.

Interaction of ADD1 with MYO10 is dependent on phosphorylation, whereby phosphorylation of ADD1 enables its binding to MYO10 on mitotic spindles. Reduction in ADD1 protein in NEK1 mutant mice is associated with hyperphosphorylation of ADD1, thereby preventing the interaction with MYO10 during meiotic spindle formation. Our results reveal a novel regulatory role for NEK1 in the regulation of spindle architecture and function during meiosis.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 8 Total Times Cited: 10 Cited Reference Count: 41","10.1371/journal.pone.0185780","polycystic kidney-disease;calmodulin-binding domain;sexual-dimorphism;chromosome segregation;microtubule-binding;mammalian meiosis;protein-kinase;germ-cells;centrosome;phosphorylation;Meiosis",NA,NA

Cells in this extraembryonic compartment match the chromosomal sex of the embryo itself. Sex differences have been observed in common gestational pathologies, highlighting the importance of maternal immune tolerance to the fetal compartment. Over the past decade, several studies examining placentas from term pregnancies have revealed widespread sex differences in hormone signaling, immune signaling, and metabolic functions. Given the rapid and dynamic development of the human placenta, sex differences that exist at term (37-42 weeks gestation) are unlikely to align precisely with those present at earlier stages when the fetal-maternal interface is being formed and the foundations of a healthy or diseased pregnancy are established. While fetal sex as a variable is often left unreported in studies performing transcriptomic profiling of the first-trimester human placenta, four recent studies have specifically examined fetal sex in early human placental development. In this review, we discuss the findings from these publications and consider the evidence for the genetic, hormonal, and immune mechanisms that are theorized to account for sex differences in early human placenta. We also highlight the cellular and molecular processes that are most likely to be impacted by fetal sex and the evolutionary pressures that may have given rise to these differences. With growing recognition of the fetal origins of health and disease, it is important to shed light on sex differences in early prenatal development, as these observations may unlock insight into the foundations of sex-biased pathologies that emerge later in life.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 0 Total Times Cited: 0 Cited Reference Count: 113","10.1186/s13293-022-00459-7","Sex;Placenta;Differences;Gene expression;Fetal;Transcriptome;Pregnancy complications;HUMAN CHORIONIC-GONADOTROPIN;X-CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION;SERUM HCG LEVELS;FETAL SEX;GESTATIONAL-AGE;GENE-EXPRESSION;MATERNAL SERUM;PREGNANT-WOMEN;FEMALE;GENDER;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Sex Characteristics",NA,NA

FBXL10 is expressed as two isoforms: FBXL10-1, a longer form that contains an N-terminal histone demethylase domain with C-terminal F-box, CXXC, PHD, RING, and leucinerich repeat domains, and FBXL10-2, a shorter form that initiates at an alternative internal exon and which lacks the histone demethylase domain but retains all other annotated domains. Selective deletion of Fbxl10-1 had been reported to produce a low penetrance and variable phenotype; most of the mutant animals were essentially normal. We constructed mutant mouse strains that were either null for Fbxl10-2 but wild type for Fbxl10-1 or null for both Fbxl10-1 and Fbxl10-2. Results: Deletion of Fbxl10-2 (in a manner that does not perturb expression of Fbxl10-1) produced a phenotype very different from the Fbxl10-1 mutant, with craniofacial abnormalities, neural tube defects, and increased lethality, especially in females. Mutants that lacked both FBXL10-1 and FBXL10-2 showed embryonic lethality and even more extreme sexual dimorphism, with more severe gene dysregulation in mutant female embryos. X-linked genes were most severely dysregulated, and there was marked overexpression of Xist in mutant females although genes that encode factors that bind to Xist RNA were globally downregulated in mutant female as compared to male embryos. Conclusions: FBXL10 is the first factor shown to be required both for the normal expression and function of the Xist gene and for normal expression of proteins that associate with Xist RNA; it is proposed that FBXL10 coordinates the expression of Xist RNA with proteins that associate with this RNA. The function of FBXL10 is largely independent of the histone demethylase activity of the long form of the protein.","L613934413 2017-01-06 2017-01-31","10.1186/s13072-016-0069-1","chromosome protein;FBXL10 protein;RNA;unclassified drug;animal experiment;animal model;animal tissue;article;binding affinity;binding site;chromosome aberration;controlled study;craniofacial malformation;disease activity;down regulation;embryo;embryotoxicity;Fbxl10 1 gene;Fbxl10 2 gene;FBXL10 gene;female;gene;gene function;male;molecular dynamics;molecular pathology;mouse;neural tube defect;nonhuman;phenotype;priority journal;protein determination;protein function;RNA binding;sex difference;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome",NA,NA

J.","",NA,NA,NA,"Background: While many sex differences in structure and function of the mammalian brain have been described, the molecular correlates of these differences are not broadly known. Also unknown is how sex differences at the protein level are perturbed by mutations that lead to intellectual disability (ID). Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of ID and is due to trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) and the resulting increased expression of Hsa21-encoded genes. The Dp(10)1Yey mouse model (Dp10) of DS is trisomic for orthologs of 39 Hsa21 protein-coding genes that map to mouse chromosome 10 (Mmu10), including four genes with known sex differences in functional properties. How these genes contribute to the DS cognitive phenotype is not known. Methods: Using reverse phase protein arrays, levels of similar to 100 proteins/protein modifications were measured in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex of female and male controls and their trisomic Dp10 littermates. Proteins were chosen for their known roles in learning/memory and synaptic plasticity and include components of the MAPK, MTOR, and apoptosis pathways, immediate early genes, and subunits of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Protein levels were compared between genotypes, sexes, and brain regions using a three-level mixed effects model and the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. Results: In control mice, levels of approximately one half of the proteins differ significantly between females and males in at least one brain region; in the hippocampus alone, levels of 40 % of the proteins are significantly higher in females. Trisomy of the Mmu10 segment differentially affects female and male profiles, perturbing protein levels most in the cerebellum of female Dp10 and most in the hippocampus of male Dp10. Cortex is minimally affected by sex and genotype. Diverse pathways and processes are implicated in both sex and genotype differences. Conclusions: The extensive sex differences in control mice in levels of proteins involved in learning/memory illustrate the molecular complexity underlying sex differences in normal neurological processes. The sex-specific abnormalities in the Dp10 suggest the possibility of sex-specific phenotypic features in DS and reinforce the need to use female as well as male mice, in particular in preclinical evaluations of drug responses.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 25 Total Times Cited: 25 Cited Reference Count: 89","10.1186/s13293-015-0043-9","Trisomy 21;Dp(10)1Yey;Mouse chromosome 10;Hippocampus;Learning and memory deficits;TRPM2;S100B;Cerebellum;Intellectual disability;GENE-EXPRESSION;TRPM2 CHANNELS;CHROMOSOME COMPLEMENT;COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE;NEURITE OUTGROWTH;X-INACTIVATION;RECEPTOR;FLUOXETINE;MICE;ACTIVATION;Sex Characteristics;Brain",NA,NA

S.","https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L70811078&from=export",NA,NA,NA,"Preimplantation development is a key period for the establishment of epigenetic marks, as complete epigenetic reprogramming involving DNA methylation and histone modifications occurs from the gametes to the blastocyst stage. The changing epigenetic landscape makes preimplantation embryos especially vulnerable to modifications of the epigenome initiated by assisted reproduction techniques or factors, such as maternal diet and exposure to toxic compounds. Such changes may result in long term developmental and health consequences for the offspring, which can be manifested in a sex-specific manner. Additionally, preimplantation bovine embryos are known to display sexual dimorphism in transcription of certain genes with roles in DNA methylation and regulation of transcription, and these differences correlate with the extent of methylation of specific sequences. The aim of this study has been to compare the sex-related differences in the expression of nine genes implicated in epigenetic regulation in mouse blastocysts. In vivo derived blastocysts were obtained from CD1 females mated with Tg(CAG-EGFP)D4Nagy/J males, which have a copy of a GFP gene inserted into their X chromosome, thereby allowing males and females to be distinguished under a fluorescent microscope. Five groups of 10 embryos of each sex were used in the analyses. PolyA RNA was extracted by Dynabeads. After revese transcription, mRNA abundance relative to the housekeeping gene, H2afz, was obtained by qPCR. The genes analyzed were related with maintenance (Dnmt1) or de novo (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) DNA methylation, DNA demethylation (Mbd2 and Mbd3), and two pairs of sex chromosome encoded genes related with histone demethylation of H3K27 (Kdm6a - previously known as Utx- and Uty) and H3K4 (Kdm5c - previously known as Jarid1c- and Kdm5d - Jarid1d-). The expression level of the 4 genes with roles in DNA methylation did not differ between sexes. However, the two X-linked genes, Kdm6a and Kdm5c, escaped X inactivation and were overexpressed in females (ANOVA P<0.05; male vs female, mean Â± SEM; Kdm6a 1 Â± 0.1 vs 1.83 Â± 0.1; Kdm5c 1 Â± 0.1 vs 1.54 Â± 0.1); whereas, the expression of the two Y-linked (Uty and Kdm5d) genes was, as expected, restricted to males. The mRNA and protein sequences of both gene pairs and their proteins have diverged over evolution, specially in the case of KDM6A/UTY (KDM5C/KDM5D proteins 80% identity, 95% coverage; KDM6A/UTY proteins 77% identity, 85% coverage), which may indicate a functional divergence. Interestingly, H3K27me3 is involved in X-chromosome inactivation and, recently, it has been proposed to exert a major role in ICM/TE differentiation and ES derivation. The sexually dimorphic patterns in the expression of these genes may explain the differences in susceptibilities to epigenetic modifications between male and female embryos, and a possible effect of sex chromosome dosage on pluripotency and differentiation.","L70811078 2012-07-20","","protein;DNA;messenger RNA;toxic substance;histone;CD1 antigen;RNA;gene;mouse;society;sex difference;female;male;DNA methylation;embryo;blastocyst;identity;sex chromosome;demethylation;X chromosome inactivation;histone modification;gamete;amino acid sequence;exposure;maternal nutrition;progeny;infertility therapy;X chromosome;preimplantation embryo;microscope;housekeeping gene;methylation;landscape;health",NA,NA

In one of these (chronic myeloid leukemia), there is an associated pathognomonic chromosomal abnormality known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This leads to constitutive tyrosine kinase activity which is responsible for the disease and is used as a target for effective therapy. This review concentrates on the search in the other conditions (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic mylofibrosis) for a similar biological marker with therapeutic potential. There is no obvious chromosomal marker in these conditions and yet evidence of clonality can be obtained in females by the use of X-inactivation patterns. PRV-1mRNA over expression, raised vitamin B12 levels and raised neutrophil alkaline phosphatase scores are evidence that cells in these conditions have received excessive signals for proliferation, maturation and reduced apoptosis. The ability of erythroid colonies to grow spontaneously without added external erythropoietin in some cases, provided a useful marker and a clue to this abnormal signaling. In the past year several important discoveries have been made which go a long way in elucidating the involved pathways. The recently discovered JAK2 V617F mutation which occurs in the majority of cases of polycythemia vera and in about half of the cases with the two other conditions, enables constitutive tyrÃ²sine kinase activity without the need for ligand binding to hematopoietic receptors. This mutation has become the biological marker for these conditions and has spurred the development of a specific therapy to neutralize its effects. The realization that inherited mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) can cause a phenotype of thrombocytosis such as in Mpl Baltimore (K39N) and in a Japanese family with S505A, has prompted the search for acquired mutations in this receptor in chronic myeloproliferative disease. Recently, two mutations have been found; W515L and W515K. These mutations have been evident in patients with essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis but not in polycythemia vera. They presumably act by causing constitutional, activating conformational changes in the receptor. The discovery of JAK2 and Mpl mutations is leading to rapid advancements in understanding the pathophysiology and in the treatment of these diseases.

A debated issue is if-and to what extent-melanoma development can be attributed to gender-specific behaviors or to biologically intrinsic differences. In the search for factors responsible for the divergences, a pivotal role of sex hormones has been observed, although conflicting results indicate the involvement of other mechanisms. The presence on the X chromosome of numerous miRNAs and coding genes playing immunological roles represents another important factor, whose relevance can be even increased by the incomplete X chromosome random inactivation. Considering the known advantages of the female immune system, a different cancer immune surveillance efficacy was suggested to explain some sex disparities. Indeed, the complexity of this picture emerged when the recently developed immunotherapies unexpectedly showed better improvements in men than in women.

Three major categories of sex-biasing factors are activational and organizational effects of gonadal hormones, and sex chromosome effects operating outside of the gonads. These three types of effects can be discriminated from each other with established experimental designs and animal models. Two important mouse models, which allow conclusions regarding the sex-biasing effects of sex chromosome complement, interacting with gonadal hormone effects, are the Four Core Genotypes model and the XY* model. Chromosome Y consomic strains give information about the role of the Y chromosome. An important recent change in sexual differentiation theory is the increasing realization that sex-biasing factors can counteract the effects of each other, reducing rather than producing sex differences in phenotype.

Epilepsy, sensory hypersensitivities, and several other neuropsychiatric symptoms are also common in FXS and ASD. FXS is caused by a >200 CGG-repeat on the FMR1 gene, located on the X-chromosome, that silences its transcription, preventing expression of the protein, FMRP. Possessing a single X-chromosome, FXS occurs more frequently in males than females. Males with FXS typically have more severe clinical symptoms than females with FXS. For example, males are more than twice as likely to have epilepsy. Genetic mosaicism (X-inactivation) in females with FXS is the presumed, exclusive reason for the lower symptom severity. Our results presented here challenge this presumption. During preclinical testing of Fmr1 knock-out mice, we observed a statistically significant, higher prevalence of audiogenic seizures in juvenile (P23- P25), male Fmr1 knock-out mice (89%) compared to juvenile, female Fmr1 knock-out mice (50%) (P=0.01, N=19 males and N=18 females), closely paralleling the sex difference in epilepsy prevalence in FXS. Importantly, however, female Fmr1 knock-out mice are homozygous for the mutated Fmr1 gene, and therefore, like male Fmr1 knock-out mice, do not express FMRP. We also found that expression of the serotonin receptor, 5-HT1AR, was significantly elevated in whole brains of adult, male Fmr1 knock-out mice, compared to wild-type mice (P=0.04, N=8 each); we did not observe this difference in female mice (P=0.24, N=7 each). We are currently investigating whether 5-HT1ARs contribute to the sex difference in audiogenic seizure susceptibility. In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that the reduced symptom severity in females with FXS may not be solely attributed to X-inactivation of the mutated FMR1 allele.","L637862395 2022-05-03","10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.06309","endogenous compound;fragile X mental retardation protein;serotonin receptor;adolescent;adult;allele;animal experiment;animal model;audiogenic seizure;brain;conference abstract;controlled study;epilepsy;female;fragile X syndrome;gene expression;gene frequency;genetic association;homozygosity;human;juvenile;knockout mouse;male;mosaicism;mouse;nonhuman;preclinical study;prevalence;protein expression;sex difference;wild type mouse;X chromosome;X chromosome inactivation;Mice;Sex Characteristics",NA,NA

One important biological factor underlying this sex bias is the X-chromosome, which is enriched for immunity-related genes. Female mammals use X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) to generate a transcriptionally silent inactive X-chromosome enriched with heterochromatic modifications and the long noncoding RNA Xist, which equalizes gene expression between the sexes. We have discovered that XCI is maintained differently in female lymphocytes from mice and humans, where Xist RNA and heterochromatic modifications dynamically associate with the inactive X-chromosome. Mature naÃ¯ve B cells are missing Xist RNA and heterochromatin marks on the inactive X, and these marks return to most cells with in vitro stimulation. We found that the chromatin of the inactive X changes during early B cell commitment, at the pro-B cell stage, initiated by the loss of Xist RNA localization. In mature lymphocytes, we found evidence of biallelic expression and increased dosage of immunity-related X-linked genes including TLR7 and CXCR3, in support of relaxed transcriptional silence from the inactive X. During B cell activation, Xist RNA is relocalized to the inactive X by the transcription factor YY1, in a novel two-step process unique to B cells. YY1-mediated relocalization of Xist RNA during B cell stimulation is necessary for enrichment of heterochromatin modifications and maintenance of X-linked gene silencing. Furthermore, we examined lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disorder with a strong female bias, and observed mislocalized XIST RNA transcripts and evidence of biallelic expression of immunity-related genes from both X-chromosomes. We propose that the Xi in female lymphocytes is predisposed to become partially reactivated and to overexpress immunity-related genes, providing the first mechanistic evidence for the female-specific enhanced immune responses and increased susceptibility for autoimmunity.","L622545809 2018-06-18","","chemokine receptor CXCR3;endogenous compound;toll like receptor 7;transcription factor YY1;adult;allele;animal cell;animal experiment;autoimmunity;B lymphocyte activation;cell stimulation;conference abstract;controlled study;female;gene overexpression;gene silencing;genetic susceptibility;heterochromatin;immune response;in vitro study;mouse;nonhuman;pre B lymphocyte;protein expression;systemic lupus erythematosus;X chromosome inactivation;X Chromosome;Lymphocytes",NA,NA

Sex chromosome abnormalities, such as Turner's syndrome (monosomy X), are associated with aortic vascular disease. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an XY sex chromosome complement in females promotes AngII-induced AAAs. In addition, as previous studies demonstrated that testosterone promotes AngII-induced AAAs in male mice, we determined if testosterone would augment AAA severity in XY females. Methods and Results: Transgenic male mice with deletion of Sry from the Y-chromosome expressing Sry on autosomes (8-12 weeks of age) were bred to female Ldlr-/-mice to generate female mice with an XY or an XX sex chromosome complement. Female mice (XX and XY) were fed a Western diet and segregated into sham and ovariectomized (OVX) groups. Two weeks later, mice were implanted with osmotic minipumps to infuse AngII (1,000 ng/kg/min) for 28 days. The AAA incidence (XX sham, 40%; XX OVX 29%; XY sham, 71%; XY OVX, 57%, p=0.031) and rupture rate (XX sham, 0%; XX OVX 0%; XY sham, 35%; XY OVX, 29%, p=0.003) were significantly increased in XY compared to XX females. Internal abdominal aortic lumen diameters were significantly increased in XY OVX versus XX OVX female mice at day 27 (XY, 2.31 Â± 0.14; XX, 1.58 Â± 0.2, p= 0.009). Moreover, AAA external diameters were significantly increased in XY OVX versus XX OVX females (XY, 2.34 Â± 0.15; XX, 1.71 Â± 0.18, p=0.0004). Administration of testosterone to adult female XY mice as well as neonatal female mice markedly enhanced AAA rupture (maximum of 73%). DNA microarrays of abdominal aortas revealed that male specific genes on the Y chromosome and inflammatory genes were enriched in aortas from XY females, while genes that escape X-inactivation were enriched in aortas from XX females. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that an XY sex chromosome complement is sufficient to promote a high AAA incidence, and markedly increase AAA severity in female mice. Moreover, testosterone augmented AAA ruptures in XY females. Future studies will identify gene targets influenced by sex chromosome complement and/or testosterone.","L618008836 2017-08-31","","angiotensin II;endogenous compound;testosterone;abdominal aortic aneurysm;adult;animal experiment;animal model;autosome;controlled study;DNA microarray;drug toxicity;female;hypercholesterolemia;low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse;male;mouse;newborn;nonhuman;osmotic minipump;transgene;Western diet;X chromosome inactivation;Y chromosome;Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal;Sex Chromosomes;Aortic Aneurysm",NA,NA

Methods: Patients with mutations or chromosomal disruptions affecting ARHGEF9 were identified through our clinics and review of the literature. Detailed medical history and examination findings were obtained via a standardized questionnaire, or if this was not possible by reviewing the published phenotypic features. Results: A total of 18 patients (including 5 females) were identified. Six had de novo, 5 had maternally inherited mutations, and 7 had chromosomal disruptions. All females had strongly skewed X-inactivation in favor of the abnormal X-chromosome. Symptoms presented in early childhood with delayed motor development alone or in combination with seizures. Intellectual disability was severe in most and moderate in patients with milder mutations. Males with severe intellectual disability had severe, often intractable, epilepsy and exhibited a particular facial dysmorphism. Patients with mutations in exon 9 affecting the protein's PH domain did not develop epilepsy. Conclusions: ARHGEF9 encodes a crucial neuronal synaptic protein; loss of function of which results in severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and a particular facial dysmorphism.

Many explanations have been proposed but have not withstood critical scrutiny. Prior analysis of different cancers with a sex bias has identified six X-linked genes that escape X chromosome inactivation in females and are, therefore, potentially involved in sex differences in survival. Four of the genes are well-known epigenetic regulators that are known to influence the expression of hundreds of other genes and signaling pathways in cancer. Methods: Survival and interaction analysis were performed on the skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), comparing high vs. low expression ofKDM6A,ATRX,KDM5C,andDDX3X. The Leeds melanoma cohort (LMC) on 678 patients with primary melanoma was used as a validation cohort. Results: Analysis of TCGA data revealed that two of these genes-KDM6AandATRX-were associated with improved survival from melanoma. TumoralKDM6Awas expressed at higher levels in females and was associated with inferred lymphoid infiltration into melanoma. Gene set analysis of highKDM6Ashowed strong associations with immune responses and downregulation of genes associated with Myc and other oncogenic pathways. The LMC analysis confirmed the prognostic significance ofKDM6Aand its interaction withEZH2but also revealed the expression ofKDM5CandDDX3Xto be prognostically significant. The analysis also confirmed a partial correlation ofKDM6Awith immune tumor infiltrates. Conclusion: When considered together, the results from these two series are consistent with the involvement of X-linked epigenetic regulators in the improved survival of females from melanoma. The identification of gene signatures associated with their expression presents insights into the development of new treatment initiatives but provides a basis for exploration in future studies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 9 Total Times Cited: 9 Cited Reference Count: 51","10.3390/cancers12082082","melanoma;sex difference;X-linked genes;X chromosome inactivation;epigenetic regulators;histone demethylase;EZH2 inhibitor;GSEA;immune response;survival;TCGA;SKCM;LMC;EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION;DENDRITIC CELLS;POOLED ANALYSIS;EXPRESSION;STAGE;TRAFFICKING;GENDER;RNA;AGE;Melanoma",NA,NA

These sex differences have been variously attributed to hormones, sex chromosomes, genotype Ã sex effects, differences in behavior, and differences in environmental exposures; however, their mechanisms and underlying biology remain largely unknown. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides an opportunity to investigate the prevalence and genetic mechanisms of sex differences in the human transcriptome by surveying many tissues that have not previously been characterized in this manner. RATIONALE: To characterize sex differences in the human transcriptome and its regulation, and to discover how sex and genetics interact to influence complex traits and disease, we generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and its genetic regulation across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the GTEx project (v8 data release), analyzing 16,245 RNA-sequencing samples and genotypes of 838 adult individuals. We report sex differences in gene expression levels, tissue cell type composition, and cis expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs). To assess their impact, we integrated these results with gene function, transcription factor binding annotation, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of 87 GWASs. RESULTS: Sex effects on gene expression are ubiquitous (13,294 sex-biased genes across all tissues). However, these effects are small and largely tissue-specific. Genes with sex-differentiated expression are not primarily driven by tissue-specific gene expression and are involved in a diverse set of biological functions, such as drug and hormone response, embryonic development and tissue morphogenesis, fertilization, sexual reproduction and spermatogenesis, fat metabolism, cancer, and immune response. Whereas X-linked genes with higher expression in females suggest candidates for escape from X-chromosome inactivation, sex-biased expression of autosomal genes suggests hormone-related transcription factor regulation and a role for additional transcription factors, as well as sex-differentiated distribution of epigenetic marks, particularly histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Sex differences in the genetic regulation of gene expression are much less common (369 sex-biased eQTLs across all tissues) and are highly tissue-specific. We identified 58 gene-trait associations driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These include loci where sex-differentiated cell type abundances mediate genotype-phenotype associations, as well as loci where sex may play a more direct role in the underlying molecular mechanism of the association. For example, we identified a female-specific eQTL in liver for the hexokinase HKDC1 that influences glucose metabolism in pregnant females, which is subsequently reflected in the birth weight of the offspring. CONCLUSION: By integrating sex-aware analyses of GTEx data with gene function and transcription factor binding annotations, we describe tissue-specific and tissue-shared drivers and mechanisms contributing to sex differences in the human transcriptome and eQTLs. We discovered multiple sex-differentiated genetic effects on gene expression that colocalize with complex trait genetic associations, thereby facilitating the mechanistic interpretation of GWAS signals. Because the causative tissue is unknown for many phenotypes, analysis of the diverse GTEx tissue collection can serve as a powerful resource for investigations into the basis of sex-biased traits. This work provides an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation.","L2008035736 2020-11-26 2021-02-15","10.1126/science.Aba3066","transcriptome;adult;article;cell composition;controlled study;expression quantitative trait locus;female;gene expression;gene expression level;gene expression regulation;genetic association;genetic regulation;genome-wide association study;genotype;human;human genetics;human tissue;male;priority journal;sex difference;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Gene Expression",NA,NA
