P.","We took advantage of overlapping interstitial deletions at chromosome 8p11-p12 in two individuals with contiguous gene syndromes and defined an interval of roughly 540 kb associated with a dominant form of Kallmann syndrome, KAL2. We establish here that loss-of-function mutations in FGFR1 underlie KAL2 whereas a gain-of-function mutation in FGFR1 has been shown to cause a form of craniosynostosis. Moreover, we suggest that the KAL1 gene product, the extracellular matrix protein anosmin-1, is involved in FGF signaling and propose that the gender difference in anosmin-1 dosage (because KAL1 partially escapes X inactivation) explains the higher prevalence of the disease in males.","experiment","FGFR1","","","","EXCI","kallmann syndrome","","","","","","relevant"
"2",170,"Gender, aging and longevity in humans: an update of an intriguing/neglected scenario paving the way to a gender-specific medicine",2016,"Clinical Science","Ostan, R. and Monti, D. and Gueresi, P. and Bussolotto, M. and Franceschi, C. and Baggio, G.","Data showing a remarkable gender difference in life expectancy and mortality, including survival to extreme age, are reviewed starting from clinical and demographic data and stressing the importance of a comprehensive historical perspective and a gene-environment/lifestyle interaction. Gender difference regarding prevalence and incidence of the most important age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, Type 2 diabetes, disability, autoimmunity and infections, are reviewed and updated with particular attention to the role of the immune system and immunosenescence. On the whole, gender differences appear to be pervasive and still poorly considered and investigated despite their biomedical relevance. The basic biological mechanisms responsible for gender differences in aging and longevity are quite complex and still poorly understood. The present review focuses on centenarians and their offspring as a model of healthy aging and summarizes available knowledge on three basic biological phenomena, i.e. age-related X chromosome inactivation skewing, gut microbiome changes and maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA genetic variants. In conclusion, an appropriate gender-specific medicine approach is urgently needed and should be systematically pursued in studies on healthy aging, longevity and age-related diseases, in a globalized world characterized by great gender differences which have a high impact on health and diseases.","review","","","","","XCI","cardiovascular, neurological, cancer, type 2 diabetes, disability, autoimmune, infection","","","","","","relevant"
